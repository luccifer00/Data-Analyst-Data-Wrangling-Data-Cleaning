(No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)Since both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime. These can come in the form of a square-like $3^2$ with $3$ divisors, or a fourth power like $2^4$ with $5$ divisors. We then find the smallest such values by hand.$2^2$ has two possibilities: $3$ and $4$ or $4$ and $5$. Neither works.$3^2$ has two possibilities: $8$ and $9$ or $9$ and $10$. $\\boxed{(8,9)}$ and $\\boxed{(9,10)}$ both work.$2^4$ has two possibilities: $15$ and $16$ or $16$ and $17$. Only $\\boxed{(16,17)}$ works.$5^2$ has two possibilities: $24$ and $25$ or $25$ and $26$. Only $\\boxed{(25,26)}$ works.$7^2$ has two possibilities: $48$ and $49$ or $49$ and $50$. Neither works.$3^4$ has two possibilities: $80$ and $81$ or $81$ and $82$. Neither works.$11^2$ has two possibilities: $120$ and $121$ or $121$ and $122$. Only $\\boxed{(121,122)}$ works.$13^2$ has two possibilities: $168$ and $169$ or $169$ and $170$. Neither works.$17^2$ has two possibilities: $288$ and $289$ or $289$ and $290$. Neither works.$19^2$ has two possibilities: $360$ and $361$ or $361$ and $362$. Only $\\boxed{(361,362)}$ works.Having computed the working possibilities, we take the sum of the corresponding values of $n$: $8+9+16+25+121+361 = \\boxed{\\textbf{540}}$.\n"]}],"source":["print(reduced_df[8][1])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8a48d452-6911-4d38-80e2-7715943eeb28","_uuid":"00992850-1633-4e81-9aa1-4977167d4abc","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-18T22:52:43.568680Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-18T22:52:43.568093Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-18T22:52:43.574893Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-18T22:52:43.573551Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-18T22:52:43.568641Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["full_detailed_df
