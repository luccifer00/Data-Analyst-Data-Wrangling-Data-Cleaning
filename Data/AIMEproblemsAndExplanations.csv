7737,Consider the integer\[N = 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 + \cdots + \underbrace{99\ldots 99}_\text{321 digits}.\]Find the sum of the digits of $N$.,342,"Let's express the number in terms of $10^n$. We can obtain $(10-1)+(10^2-1)+(10^3-1)+\cdots+(10^{321}-1)$. By the commutative and associative property, we can group it into $(10+10^2+10^3+\cdots+10^{321})-321$. We know the former will yield $1111....10$, so we only have to figure out what the last few digits are. There are currently $321$ 1's. We know the last four digits are $1110$, and that the others will not be affected if we subtract $321$. If we do so, we get that $1110-321=789$. This method will remove three $1$'s, and add a $7$, $8$ and $9$. Therefore, the sum of the digits is $(321-3)+7+8+9=\boxed{342}$","A similar and simpler way to consider the initial manipulations is to observe that adding $1$ to each term results in $(10+100+... 10^{320}+10^{321})$. There are $321$ terms, so it becomes $11...0$, where there are $322$ digits in $11...0$. Then, subtract the $321$ you initially added.","We can see that $9=9$, $9+99=108$, $9+99+999=1107$, all the way to ten nines when we have $11111111100$. Then, when we add more nines, we repeat the same process, and quickly get that the sum of digits is $\boxed{342}$ since we have to add $9\lfloor \log 321 \rfloor$ to the sum of digits, which is $9\lceil \frac{321}9 \rceil$.","Observe how adding results in the last term but with a $1$ concatenated in front and also a $1$ subtracted ($09$, $108$, $1107$, $11106$). Then for any index of terms, $n$, the sum is $11...10-n$, where the first term is of length $n+1$. Here, that is $\boxed{342}$.",Write\begin{align*}N &=(10-1)+(10^2-1)+\cdots+(10^{321}-1)\\ &=10+10^2+10^3+10^4+10^5+10^6+\cdots 10^{321}-321 \\ &=1110-321+10^4+10^5+10^6+\cdots+10^{321}\\ &=789+10^4+10^5+10^6+\cdots+10^{321}\\ \end{align*}The sum of the digits of $N$ is therefore equal to $7+8+9+(321-3)=342$.
7738,"Jenn randomly chooses a number $J$ from $1, 2, 3,\ldots, 19, 20$. Bela then randomly chooses a number $B$ from $1, 2, 3,\ldots, 19, 20$ distinct from $J$. The value of $B - J$ is at least $2$ with a probability that can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",29,"By symmetry, the desired probability is equal to the probability that $J - B$ is at most $-2$, which is $\frac{1-P}{2}$ where $P$ is the probability that $B$ and $J$ differ by $1$ (no zero, because the two numbers are distinct). There are $20 \cdot 19 = 380$ total possible combinations of $B$ and $J$, and $1 + 18 \cdot 2 + 1 = 38$ ones that form $P$, so $P = \frac{38}{380} = \frac{1}{10}$. Therefore the answer is $\frac{9}{20} \rightarrow \boxed{029}$.","$B-J \ne 0$ because $B \ne J$, so the probability that $B-J < 0$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ by symmetry. The probability that $B-J = 1$ is $\frac{19}{20 \times 19} = \frac{1}{20}$ because there are 19 pairs: $(B,J) = (2,1), \ldots, (20,19)$. The probability that $B-J \ge 2$ is $1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{20} = \frac{9}{20} \implies \boxed{029}$","There are $\tbinom{20}{2}=190$ equally likely pairs $\{J,B\}$. In $19$ of these pairs $(\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{3,4\}\dots,\{19,20\})$, the numbers differ by less than 2, so the probability that the numbers differ by at least 2 is $1-\tfrac{19}{190}=\tfrac9{10}$. Then $B-J\ge 2$ holds in exactly half of these cases, so it has probability $\tfrac12\cdot\tfrac9{10}=\tfrac{9}{20}$. The requested sum is $9+20=29$","This problem is essentially asking how many ways there are to choose $2$ distinct elements from a $20$ element set such that no $2$ elements are adjacent. Using the well-known formula $\dbinom{n-k+1}{k}$, there are $\dbinom{20-2+1}{2} = \dbinom{19}{2} = 171$ ways. Dividing $171$ by $380$, our desired probability is $\frac{171}{380} = \frac{9}{20}$. Thus, our answer is $9+20=\boxed{029}$. ","Create a grid using graph paper, with $20$ columns for the values of $J$ from $1$ to $20$ and $20$ rows for the values of $B$ from $1$ to $20$. Since $B$ cannot equal $J$, we cross out the diagonal line from the first column of the first row to the twentieth column of the last row. Now, since $B - J$ must be at least $2$, we can mark the line where $B - J = 2$. Now we sum the number of squares that are on this line and below it. We get $171$. Then we find the number of total squares, which is $400 - 20 = 380$. Finally, we take the ratio $\frac{171}{380}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9}{20}$. Our answer is $9+20=\boxed{029}$."

Points $A$ and $B$ lie on $\overline{PQ}$, points $C$ and $D$ lie on $\overline{QR}$, and points $E$ and $F$ lie on $\overline{PR}$, with $PA=QB=QC=RD=RE=PF=5$. Find the area of hexagon $ABCDEF$",120,"We know the area of the hexagon $ABCDEF$ to be $\triangle PQR- \triangle PAF- \triangle BCQ- \triangle RED$. Since $PR^2+RQ^2=PQ^2$, we know that $\triangle PRQ$ is a right triangle. Thus the area of $\triangle PQR$ is $150$. Another way to compute the area is\[\frac12 \cdot PQ\cdot RQ \sin \angle PQR = \frac12 \cdot 500 \cdot \sin \angle PQR=150 \implies \sin \angle PQR = \frac35.\]Then the area of $\triangle BCQ = \frac12 \cdot BQ \cdot CQ \cdot \sin \angle PQR= \frac{25}{2}\cdot \frac{3}{5}=\frac{15}{2}$. Preceding in a similar fashion for $\triangle PAF$, the area of $\triangle PAF$ is $10$. Since $\angle ERD = 90^{\circ}$, the area of $\triangle RED=\frac{25}{2}$. Thus our desired answer is $150-\frac{15}{2}-10-\frac{25}{2}=\boxed{120}$","Let $R$ be the origin. Noticing that the triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle, we can see that $A=(4,12), B=(16,3), C=(15,0), D=(5,0), E=(0,5)$, and $F=(0,10)$. Using the shoelace theorem, the area is $\boxed{120}$.

Then, by similar triangles, the altitude from $B$ to $QC$ has length $3$ and the altitude from $A$ to $FP$ has length $4$, so $[QBC]+[DRE]+[AFP]=\frac{15}{2}+\frac{25}{2}+\frac{20}{2}=30$, meaning that $[ABCDEF]=\boxed{120}$. ","Knowing that $\triangle{PQR}$ has area $150$ and is a $3$-$4$-$5$ triangle, we can find the area of the smaller triangles $\triangle{DRE}$, $\triangle{APF}$, and $\triangle{CQB}$ and subtract them from $\triangle{PQR}$ to obtain our answer. First off, we know $\triangle{DRE}$ has area $12.5$ since it is a right triangle. To the find the areas of $\triangle{APF}$ and $\triangle{CQB}$ , we can use Law of Cosines ($c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C$) to find the lengths of $AF$ and $CB$, respectively. Computing gives $AF = \sqrt{20}$ and $CB = \sqrt{10}$. Now, using Heron's Formula, we find $\triangle{APF} = 10$ and $\triangle{CQB} = 7.5$. Adding these and subtracting from $\triangle{PQR}$, we get $150 - (10 + 7.5 + 12.5) = \boxed{120}$ ","Triangle $PQR$ is a right triangle with are $\tfrac12\cdot15\cdot20=150$. Each of $\triangle PAF,\triangle QCB,$ and $\triangle RED$ shares an angle with $\triangle PQR$. Because the area of a triangle with sides $a,\,b,$ and included angle $\gamma$ is $\tfrac12a\cdot b\cdot \sin\gamma,$ it follows that the areas of $\triangle PAF,\triangle QCB,$ and $\triangle RED$ are each $5\cdot5\cdot\tfrac{150}{ab},$ where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the sides of $\triangle PQR$ adjacent to the shared angle. Thus the sum of the areas of $\triangle PAF,\triangle QCB,$ and $\triangle RED$ is\[5\cdot5\cdot\frac{150}{15\cdot25}+5\cdot5\cdot\frac{150}{25\cdot20}+5\cdot5\cdot\frac{150}{20\cdot15}=25\left(\frac25+\frac3{10}+\frac12\right)=30.\]Therefore $ABCDEF$ has area $150-30= \boxed{120}$ ."
7740,"A soccer team has $22$ available players. A fixed set of $11$ players starts the game, while the other $11$ are available as substitutes. During the game, the coach may make as many as $3$ substitutions, where any one of the $11$ players in the game is replaced by one of the substitutes. No player removed from the game may reenter the game, although a substitute entering the game may be replaced later. No two substitutions can happen at the same time. The players involved and the order of the substitutions matter. Let $n$ be the number of ways the coach can make substitutions during the game (including the possibility of making no substitutions). Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.",122,"There are $0-3$ substitutions. The number of ways to sub any number of times must be multiplied by the previous number. This is defined recursively. The case for $0$ subs is $1$, and the ways to reorganize after $n$ subs is the product of the number of new subs ($12-n$) and the players that can be ejected ($11$). The formula for $n$ subs is then $a_n=11(12-n)a_{n-1}$ with $a_0=1$. Summing from $0$ to $3$ gives $1+11^2+11^{3}\cdot 10+11^{4}\cdot 10\cdot 9$. Notice that $10+9\cdot11\cdot10=10+990=1000$. Then, rearrange it into $1+11^2+11^3\cdot (10+11\cdot10\cdot9)= 1+11^2+11^3\cdot (1000)$. When taking modulo $1000$, the last term goes away.

Choose one player on the field to sub out, and one player on the bench. This corresponds to $11\cdot 11 = 121$. $\textbf{Case 3}$: Two substitutions. Choose one player on the field to sub out, and one player on the bench. Once again, this is $11\cdot 11$. Now choose one more player on the field to sub out and one player on the bench that was not the original player subbed out. This gives us a total of $11\cdot 11\cdot 11\cdot 10 = 13310\equiv 310 \bmod{1000}$. $\textbf{Case 4}$: Three substitutions. Using similar logic as $\textbf{Case 3}$, we get $(11\cdot 11)\cdot (11\cdot 10)\cdot (11\cdot 9)$. The resulting number ends in $690$.

Take the fifth power of this expression and get $a^{10}+b^{10}+5a^2b^2(a^6+b^6)+10a^4b^4(a^2+b^2)=\frac{11}{36}+5a^2b^2(a^6+b^6)+10a^4b^4=1$. Note that we also have $\frac{11}{36}=a^{10}+b^{10}=(a^{10}+b^{10})(a^2+b^2)=a^{12}+b^{12}+a^2b^2(a^8+b^8)$. So, it suffices to compute $a^2b^2(a^8+b^8)$. Let $y=a^2b^2$. We have from cubing $a^2+b^2=1$ that $a^6+b^6+3a^2b^2(a^2+b^2)=1$ or $a^6+b^6=1-3y$. Next, using $\frac{11}{36}+5a^2b^2(a^6+b^6)+10a^4b^4=1$, we get $a^2b^2(a^6+b^6)+2a^4b^4=\frac{5}{36}$ or $y(1-3y)+2y^2=y-y^2=\frac{5}{36}$. Solving gives $y=\frac{5}{6}$ or $y=\frac{1}{6}$. Clearly $y=\frac{5}{6}$ is extraneous, so $y=\frac{1}{6}$. Now note that $a^4+b^4=(a^2+b^2)^2-2a^2b^2=\frac{2}{3}$, and $a^8+b^8=(a^4+b^4)^2-2a^4b^4=\frac{4}{9}-\frac{1}{18}=\frac{7}{18}$. Thus we finally get $a^{12}+b^{12}=\frac{11}{36}-\frac{7}{18}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=\frac{13}{54}$, giving $\boxed{067}$","Newton sums is basically constructing the powers of the roots of the polynomials instead of deconstructing them which was done in Solution $2$. Let $\sin^2x$ and $\cos^2x$ be the roots of some polynomial $F(a)$. Then, by Vieta, $F(a)=a^2-a+b$ for some $b=\sin^2x\cdot\cos^2x$. Let $S_k=\left(\sin^2x\right)^k+\left(\cos^2x\right)^k$. We want to find $S_6$. Clearly $S_1=1$ and $S_2=1-2b$. Newton sums tells us that $S_k-S_{k-1}+bS_{k-2}=0\Rightarrow S_k=S_{k-1}-bS_{k-2}$ where $k\ge 3$ for our polynomial $F(a)$.Bashing, we have\[S_3=S_2-bS_1\Rightarrow S_3=(1-2b)-b(1)=1-3b\]\[S_4=S_3-bS_2\Rightarrow S_4=(1-3b)-b(1-2b)=2b^2-4b+1\]\[S_5=S_4-bS_3\Rightarrow S_5=(2b^2-4b+1)-b(1-3b)=5b^2-5b+1=\frac{11}{36}\]Thus\[5b^2-5b+1=\frac{11}{36}\Rightarrow 5b^2-5b+\frac{25}{36}=0, 36b^2-36b+5=0, (6b-1)(6b-5)=0\]$b=\frac{1}{6} \text{ or } \frac{5}{6}$. Clearly, $\sin^2x\cdot\cos^2x\not=\frac{5}{6}$ so $\sin^2x\cdot\cos^2x=b=\frac{1}{6}$.Note $S_4=\frac{7}{18}$. Solving for $S_6$, we get $S_6=S_5-\frac{1}{6}S_4=\frac{13}{54}$. Finally, $13+54=\boxed{067}$","Factor the first equation.\[\sin^{10}x + \cos^{10}x = (\sin^2x+\cos^2x)(\sin^8x-\sin^6x\cos^2x+\sin^4x\cos^4x-\sin^2x\cos^6x+\cos^8x)\]First of all, $\sin^4x+\cos^4x = 1-2\sin^2x\cos^2x$ because $\sin^4x+\cos^4x=(\sin^2x + \cos^2x)^2 -2\sin^2x\cos^2x = 1 - 2\sin^2x\cos^2x$ We group the first, third, and fifth term and second and fourth term. The first group:\begin{align*} \sin^8+\sin^4x\cos^4x+\cos^8x &= (\sin^4x+\cos^4x)^2-\sin^4x\cos^4x)\\ &= (1 - 2\sin^2x\cos^2x)^2-\sin^4x\cos^4x)\\ &= 1+4\sin^4x\cos^4x-4\sin^2x\cos^2x \end{align*}The second group:\begin{align*} -\sin^6x\cos^2x-\sin^2x\cos^6x  &= -\sin^2x\cos^2x(\sin^4x+\cos^4x)\\ &= -\sin^2x\cos^2x(1-2\sin^2x\cos^2x)\\ &= -\sin^2x\cos^2x+2\sin^4x\cos^4x \end{align*}Add the two together to make\[1+4\sin^4x\cos^4x-4\sin^2x\cos^2x-\sin^2x\cos^2x+2\sin^4x\cos^4x = 1 - 5\sin^2x\cos^2x+5\sin^4x\cos^4x\]Because this equals $\frac{11}{36}$, we have\[5\sin^4x\cos^4x- 5\sin^2x\cos^2x+\frac{25}{36}=0\]Let $\sin^2x\cos^2x = a$ so we get\[5a^2- 5a+\frac{25}{36}=0 \Rightarrow a^2-a+\frac{5}{36}\]Solving the quadratic gives us\[a = \frac{1 \pm \frac{2}{3}}{2}\]Because $\sin^2x\cos^2x \le \frac{1}{4}$, we finally get $a = \frac{1 - \frac{2}{3}}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$. Now from the second equation,\begin{align*} \sin^{12}x + \cos^{12}x &= (\sin^4x+\cos^4x)(\sin^8x-\sin^4x\cos^4x+\cos^8x)\\ &= (1-2\sin^2x\cos^2x)((\sin^4x+\cos^4x)^2-3\sin^4x\cos^4x)\\ &= (1-2\sin^2x\cos^2x)((1-2\sin^2x\cos^2x)^2-3\sin^4x\cos^4x) \end{align*}Plug in $\sin^2x\cos^2x = \frac{1}{6}$ to get\[(1-2(\frac{1}{6}))(1-2(\frac{1}{6})^2-3(\frac{1}{6})^2) = \frac{13}{54}\]which yields the answer $\boxed{067}$","Define the recursion $a_n=(\sin^2 x)^n+(\cos^2 x)^n$ We know that the characteristic equation of $a_n$ must have 2 roots, so we can recursively define $a_n$ as $a_n=p*a_{n-1}+q*a_{n-2}$. $p$ is simply the sum of the roots of the characteristic equation, which is $\sin^2 x+\cos^2 x=1$. $q$ is the product of the roots, which is $-(\sin^2 x)(\cos^2 x)$. This value is not trivial and we have to solve for it. We know that $a_0=2$, $a_1=1$, $a_5=\frac{11}{36}$. Solving the rest of the recursion gives \[a_2=1+2q\]\[a_3=1+3q\]\[a_4=1+4q+2q^2\]\[a_5=1+5q+5q^2=\frac{11}{36}\]\[a_6=1+6q+9q^2+2q^3\]Solving for $q$ in the expression for $a_5$ gives us $q^2+q+\frac{5}{36}=0$, so $q=-\frac{5}{6}, -\frac{1}{6}$. Since $q=-(\sin^2 x)(\cos^2 x)$, we know that the minimum value it can attain is $-\frac{1}{4}$ by AM-GM, so $q$ cannot be $-\frac{5}{6}$. Plugging in the value of $q$ into the expression for $a_6$, we get $a_6=1-1+\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{108}=\frac{26}{108}=\frac{13}{54}$. Our final answer is then $13+54=\boxed{067}$","Let $c=\sin^2x\cdot\cos^2x$ and let $S(n)=\sin^{2n}x+\cos^{2n}x$ Then for $n\ge 1$ \begin{align*} S(n)&=(\sin^{2n}x+\cos^{2n}x)\cdot(\sin^2x+\cos^2x)\\ &=\sin^{2n+2}x+\cos^{2n+2}x+\sin^2x\cdot\cos^2x(\sin^{2n-2}x+\cos^{2n-2}x)\\ &=S(n+1)+cS(n-1). \end{align*} Because $S(0)=2$ and $S(1)=1$ it follows that $S(2)=1-2c, S(3)=1-3c,S(4)=2c^2-4c+1$ and $\frac{11}{36}=S(5)=5c^2-5c+1$ Hence $c=\frac{1}{6}$ or $\frac{5}{6}$ and because $4c=\sin^2{2x}$ the only possible value of $c$ is $\frac{1}{6}$ Therefore \[S(6)=S(5)-cS(4)=\frac{11}{36}-\frac{1}{6}\left(2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2-4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)+1\right)=\frac{13}{54}\] The requested sum is $13+54=67$"

(No integer greater than $1$ can have fewer than $2$ divisors.)Since both of these cases contain a number with an odd number of divisors, that number must be an even power of a prime.

We see that to obtain a sum of $7$, we can have $(2,5), (3,4), (4,3),$ and $(5,2)$.


Case 1: When we have $(2,5)$ For $n$ to have 2 divisors, it must be a prime number. For $n+1$ to have 5 divisors, it must be in the form $a^4$. If $n+1$ is in the form $a^4$, then $n = a^4-1 = (a^2+1)(a-1)(a+1)$. This means that $n$, or $a^4-1$ has factors other than 1 and itself; $n$ is not prime. No cases work in this case


Case 2: When we have $(4,3)$ For $n$ to have 4 divisors, it must be in the form $a^3$ or $ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are distinct prime numbers . For $n+1$ to have 3 divisors, it must be a square number. Let $n+1 = A^2$ ($A$ is a prime number). When $n = a^3, a^3+1 = A^2, (A-1)(A+1)=a^3$. We see that the only case when it works is when $a=2, A=3$, so $n=8$ works.


Case 3: When we have $(5,2)$ For $n$ to have 5 divisors, it must be in the form $a^4$, where $a$ is a prime number. For $n+1$ to have 2 divisors, it must be a prime number. Notice that $a$ and $a^4$ have the same parity (even/odd). Since every prime greater than 2 are odd, $n = a^4$ must be even. Since $a^4$ is even, $a$ must be even as well, and the only prime number that is even is 2. When $a=2, n=16$.


Case 4: When we have $(3,4)$ For $n$ to have 3 divisors, it must be a square number. For $n+1$ to have 4 divisors, it must be in the form $a^3$ or $ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are distinct prime numbers. Similar to Case 2, let $n = A^2$ ($A$ is a prime number).

When $n+1 = a^3, A^2+1 = a^3$.
There are no cases that satisfy this equation.

When $n+1=ab, A^2+1 = ab$.

The sum\[\left| \sum_{1 \le j <k \le 673} z_jz_k \right|\]can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$",352,"In order to begin this problem, we must first understand what it is asking for. The notation\[\left| \sum_{1 \le j <k \le 673} z_jz_k \right|\]simply asks for the absolute value of the sum of the product of the distinct unique roots of the polynomial taken two at a time or\[(z_1z_2+z_1z_3+ \dots + z_1z_{672}+z_1z_{673})+(z_2z_3+z_2z_4+ \dots +z_2z_{673}) + (z_3z_4+z_3z_5+ \dots +z_3z_{673}) + \dots +z_{672}z_{673}.\]Call this sum $S$.

Now we can begin the problem. Rewrite the polynomial as $P=(x-z_1)(x-z_1)(x-z_1)(x-z_2)(x-z_2)(x-z_2) \dots (x-z_{673})(x-z_{673})(x-z_{673})$. Then we have that the roots of $P$ are $z_1,z_1,z_1,z_2,z_2,z_2, \dots , z_{673},z_{673},z_{673}$.

By Vieta's formulas, we have that the sum of the roots of $P$ is $(-1)^1 \cdot \dfrac{20}{1}=-20=z_1+z_1+z_1+z_2+z_2+z_2+ \dots + z_{673}+z_{673}+z_{673}=3(z_1+z_2+z_3+ \dots +z_{673})$. Thus, $z_1+z_2+z_3+ \dots +z_{673}=- \dfrac{20}{3}.$

Similarly, we also have that the the sum of the roots of $P$ taken two at a time is $(-1)^2 \cdot \dfrac{19}{1} = 19.$ This is equal to $z_1^2+z_1^2+z_1^2+z_1z_2+z_1z_2+z_1z_2+ \dots =  \\ 3(z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2) + 9(z_1z_2+z_1z_3+z_1z_4+ \dots + z_{672}z_{673}) =  3(z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2) + 9S.$

Now we need to find and expression for $z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2$ in terms of $S$. We note that $(z_1+z_2+z_3+ \dots +z_{673})^2= (-20/3)^2=\dfrac{400}{9} \\ =(z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2)+2(z_1z_2+z_1z_3+z_1z_4+ \dots + z_{672}z_{673})=(z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2)+2S.$ Thus, $z_1^2+z_2^2+ \dots + z_{673}^2= \dfrac{400}{9} -2S$.

Plugging this into our other Vieta equation, we have $3 \left( \dfrac{400}{9} -2S \right) +9S = 19$. This gives $S = - \dfrac{343}{9} \Rightarrow \left| S \right| = \dfrac{343}{9}$. Since 343 is relatively prime to 9, $m+n = 343+9 = \fbox{352}$","This is a quick fake solve using $z_i = 0$ where $3 \le i \le 673$ and only $z_1,z_2 \neq 0$ .

By Vieta's,\[3z_1+3z_2=-20\]and\[3z_1^2+3z_2^2+9z_1z_2 = 19.\]Rearranging gives $z_1 + z_2 = \dfrac{-20}{3}$ and $3(z_1^2 + 2z_1z_2 + z_2^2) + 3z_1z_2 = 19$ giving $3(z_1 + z_2)^2 + 3z_1z_2 = 19$.

Substituting gives $3\left(\dfrac{400}{9}\right) + 3z_1z_2 = 19$ which simplifies to $\dfrac{400}{3} + 3z_1z_2 = \dfrac{57}{3}$.

So, $3z_1z_2 = \dfrac{-343}{3}$, $z_1z_2 = \dfrac{-343}{9}$, $|\dfrac{-343}{9}|=\dfrac{343}{9}$,\[m+n = 343+9 = \boxed{352}.\]","Let $x=\sum_{1\le j<k\le 673} z_jz_k$. By Vieta's,\[3\sum_{i=1}^{673}z_i=-20\implies \sum_{i=1}^{673}z_i=-\frac{20}3.\]Then, consider the $19x^{2017}$ term. To produce the product of two roots, the two roots can either be either $(z_i,z_i)$ for some $i$, or $(z_j,z_k)$ for some $j<k$. In the former case, this can happen in $\tbinom 32=3$ ways, and in the latter case, this can happen in $3^2=9$ ways. Hence,\begin{align*} 19=3\sum_{i=1}^{673} z_i^2+9\sum_{1\le j<k\le 673} z_jz_k=3\left(\left(-\frac{20}3\right)^2-2x\right)+9x&=\frac{400}3+3x\\ \implies x&=-\frac{343}9, \end{align*}and the requested sum is $343+9=\boxed{352}$.","Let\[(f(x))^3=x^{2019}+20x^{2018}+19x^{2017}+g(x).\]Therefore, $f(x)=(x-z_{1})(x-z_{1})\cdots (x-z_{673})$. This is also equivalent to\[f(x)=x^{673}+ax^{672}+bx^{671}+h(x)\]for some real coefficients $a$ and $b$ and some polynomial $h(x)$ with degree $670$. We can see that the big summation expression is simply summing the product of the roots of $f(x)$ taken two at a time. By Vieta's, this is just the coefficient $b$. The first three terms of $(f(x))^3$ can be bashed in terms of $a$ and $b$ to get\[20 = 3a\]\[19 = 3a^2+3b\]Thus, $a=\frac{20}{3}$ and $b=\frac{1}{3}\left(19-3\left(\frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \right)$. That is $|b|=\frac{343}{9}=\frac{m}{n}$. $m+n=343+9=\boxed{352}$","In the problem statement, we're given that the polynomial is $(x-z_1)^3(x-z_2)^3(x-z_3)^2\cdots (x-z_{673})^3$ which can be expressed as $x^{2019}+20x^{2018}+19x^{2017}+g(x)$. So it has 673 roots of multiplicity 3 each, for a total of 2019 roots.

We start by calling $\left| \sum_{1 \le j <k \le 673} z_jz_k \right|  = S$. Next, let the sum of the roots of the polynomial be $P_1$, which equals $3(x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_{673})$, and the sum of the square of the roots be $P_2$, which equals $3(z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2+\dots+z_{673}^2)$.

By Vieta's,\[-20 = 3(z_1+z_2+z_3+z_4 \dots+z_{673})\]\[19 = 3(z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2+\dots+z_{673}^2) + 9S\]
The latter can be easily verified by using a combinatorics approach. $19$ is the sum of all the possible pairs of two roots of the polynomial. Which has $\binom{2019}{2}$ without simplification. Now looking at the latter above, there are $3\cdot673$ terms in the first part and $9\cdot\binom{673}{2}$.

With some computation, we see $\binom{2019}{2}$ $= 3\cdot673+$ $9\cdot\binom{673}{2}$. This step was simply done to check that we missed no steps.

Now using Newton Sums, where $P_2 = z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2+\dots+z_{673}^2$. We first have that $P_1\cdot a_n + 1\cdot a_{n-1}=0$ and plugging in values, we get that $P_1\cdot 1 + 1\cdot 20 = 0 \implies P_1=-20.$ Then, $P_2\cdot a_n + P_1 \cdot a_{n-1} + 2\cdot a_{n-2}$ and plugging in the values we know, we get that

\[P_2 + -20\cdot20 + 19\cdot2 = 0 \implies P_2 = 362\]
\[19 = 362 + 9S \implies S = \frac{343}{9}\]Thus, $\frac{343}{9}$ leads to the answer $\boxed{352}$."

Ptolemy's theorem on $ABCM$ gives us\[a\alpha+b\alpha=b(\alpha+IB)\to \alpha=\frac{b*IB}{a}\]Again, by the incenter-excenter lemma, $II_B=2IM$ so $II_b=\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ as desired. Using this gives us the following equation:\[\frac{2b*IB}{a}=r+\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\frac{rs}{s-b}\]Motivated by the $s-a$ and $s-b$, we make the following substitution: $x=s-a, y=s-b$ This changes things quite a bit. Here's what we can get from it:\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and $a=rs$) that\[r=\sqrt{\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\sqrt{\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$. Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\triangle INB$,\[IB^2=r^2+(\frac{a}{2})^2=\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\[r+\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\]Cancelling some terms, we have\[\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\]Squaring,\[\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\to \frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\to x=8y\]Reverse substituting,\[s-a=8s-8b\to b=\frac{9}{2}a\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\boxed{020}$","First, assume $BC=2$ and $AB=AC=x$. The triangle can be scaled later if necessary. Let $I$ be the incenter and let $r$ be the inradius. Let the points at which the incircle intersects $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ be denoted $M$, $N$, and $O$, respectively.


Next, we calculate $r$ in terms of $x$. Note the right triangle formed by $A$, $I$, and $M$. The length $IM$ is equal to $r$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length $AN$ is $\sqrt{x^2-1}$, so the length $AI$ is $\sqrt{x^2-1}-r$. Note that $BN$ is half of $BC=2$, and by symmetry caused by the incircle, $BN=BM$ and $BM=1$, so $MA=x-1$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $AIM$, we get\[r^2+(x-1)^2=\left(\sqrt{x^2-1}-r\right)^2.\]Expanding yields\[r^2+x^2-2x+1=x^2-1-2r\sqrt{x^2-1}+r^2,\]which can be simplified to\[2r\sqrt{x^2-1}=2x-2.\]Dividing by $2$ and then squaring results in\[r^2(x^2-1)=(x-1)^2,\]and isolating $r^2$ gets us\[r^2=\frac{(x-1)^2}{x^2-1}=\frac{(x-1)^2}{(x+1)(x-1)}=\frac{x-1}{x+1},\]so $r=\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}$.


We then calculate the radius of the excircle tangent to $BC$. We denote the center of the excircle $E_N$ and the radius $r_N$.

Consider the quadrilateral formed by $M$, $I$, $E_N$, and the point at which the excircle intersects the extension of $AB$, which we denote $H$. By symmetry caused by the excircle, $BN=BH$, so $BH=1$.

Note that triangles $MBI$ and $NBI$ are congruent, and $HBE$ and $NBE$ are also congruent. Denoting the measure of angles $MBI$ and $NBI$ measure $\alpha$ and the measure of angles $HBE$ and $NBE$ measure $\beta$, straight angle $MBH=2\alpha+2\beta$, so $\alpha + \beta=90^\circ$. This means that angle $IBE$ is a right angle, so it forms a right triangle.

Setting the base of the right triangle to $IE$, the height is $BN=1$ and the base consists of $IN=r$ and $EN=r_N$. Triangles $INB$ and $BNE$ are similar to $IBE$, so $\frac{IN}{BN}=\frac{BN}{EN}$, or $\frac{r}{1}=\frac{1}{r_N}$. This makes $r_N$ the reciprocal of $r$, so $r_N=\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x-1}}$.


Circle $\omega$'s radius can be expressed by the distance from the incenter $I$ to the bottom of the excircle with center $E_N$. This length is equal to $r+2r_N$, or $\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}+2\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x-1}}$. Denote this value $r_\omega$.


Finally, we calculate the distance from the incenter $I$ to the closest point on the excircle tangent to $AB$, which forms another radius of circle $\omega$ and is equal to $r_\omega$. We denote the center of the excircle $E_M$ and the radius $r_M$. We also denote the points where the excircle intersects $AB$ and the extension of $BC$ using $J$ and $K$, respectively. In order to calculate the distance, we must find the distance between $I$ and $E_M$ and subtract off the radius $r_M$.

We first must calculate the radius of the excircle. Because the excircle is tangent to both $AB$ and the extension of $AC$, its center must lie on the angle bisector formed by the two lines, which is parallel to $BC$. This means that the distance from $E_M$ to $K$ is equal to the length of $AN$, so the radius is also $\sqrt{x^2-1}$.

Next, we find the length of $IE_M$. We can do this by forming the right triangle $IAE_M$. The length of leg $AI$ is equal to $AN$ minus $r$, or $\sqrt{x^2-1}-\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}$. In order to calculate the length of leg $AE_M$, note that right triangles $AJE_M$ and $BNA$ are congruent, as $JE_M$ and $NA$ share a length of $\sqrt{x^2-1}$, and angles $E_MAJ$ and $NAB$ add up to the right angle $NAE_M$. This means that $AE_M=BA=x$.

Using Pythagorean Theorem, we get\[IE_M=\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{x^2-1}-\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}\right)^2+x^2}.\]Bringing back\[r_\omega=IE_M-r_M\]and substituting in some values, the equation becomes\[r_\omega=\sqrt{\left(\sqrt{x^2-1}-\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}\right)^2+x^2}-\sqrt{x^2-1}.\]Rearranging and squaring both sides gets\[\left(r_\omega+\sqrt{x^2-1}\right)^2=\left(\sqrt{x^2-1}-\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}\right)^2+x^2.\]Distributing both sides yields\[r_\omega^2+2r_\omega\sqrt{x^2-1}+x^2-1=x^2-1-2\sqrt{x^2-1}\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}+\frac{x-1}{x+1}+x^2.\]Canceling terms results in\[r_\omega^2+2r_\omega\sqrt{x^2-1}=-2\sqrt{x^2-1}\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}+\frac{x-1}{x+1}+x^2.\]Since\[-2\sqrt{x^2-1}\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}=-2\sqrt{(x+1)(x-1)\frac{x-1}{x+1}}=-2(x-1),\]We can further simplify to\[r_\omega^2+2r_\omega\sqrt{x^2-1}=-2(x-1)+\frac{x-1}{x+1}+x^2.\]Substituting out $r_\omega$ gets\[\left(\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}+2\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x-1}}\right)^2+2\left(\sqrt{\frac{x-1}{x+1}}+2\sqrt{\frac{x+1}{x-1}}\right)\sqrt{x^2-1}=-2(x-1)+\frac{x-1}{x+1}+x^2\]which when distributed yields\[\frac{x-1}{x+1}+4+4\left(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\right)+2(x-1+2(x+1))=-2(x-1)+\frac{x-1}{x+1}+x^2.\]After some canceling, distributing, and rearranging, we obtain\[4\left(\frac{x+1}{x-1}\right)=x^2-8x-4.\]Multiplying both sides by $x-1$ results in\[4x+4=x^3-x^2-8x^2+8x-4x+4,\]which can be rearranged into\[x^3-9x^2=0\]and factored into\[x^2(x-9)=0.\]This means that $x$ equals $0$ or $9$, and since a side length of $0$ cannot exist, $x=9$.


As a result, the triangle must have sides in the ratio of $9:2:9$. Since the triangle must have integer side lengths, and these values share no common factors greater than $1$, the triangle with the smallest possible perimeter under these restrictions has a perimeter of $9+2+9=\boxed{020}$","For the sake of space, I've drawn only 2 of the 3 excircles because the third one looks the same as the second large one because the triangle is isosceles. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $AII_A$ and $BII_B$ are collinear, $E$ is the tangent of circle $I_B$ to $AC$, $F$ is the tangent of that circle to the extension of $BC$, and $J$ is the tangent of the circle to the extension of $BA$. The interesting part of the diagram is circle $\omega$, which is internally tangent to circle $I_A$ yet externally tangent to circle $I_B$. Therefore, perhaps we can relate the radius of this circle to the semiperimeter of triangle $ABC$.

We can see that the radius of circle $\omega$ is $2r_{I_A}+r$ using the incenter and A-excenter of our main triangle. This radius is also equal to $BI_B - BI - r_{I_B}$ from the incenter and B-excenter of our triangle. Thus, we can solve for each of these separately in terms of the lengths of the triangle and set them equal to each other to form an equation.

To find the left hand side of the equation, we have to first find $r$ and $r_{I_A}$. Let $a = AB = AC, b = BD = DC,$ and $h = AD$. Then since the perimeter of the triangle is $2a+2b$, the semiperimeter is $a+b$.

Now let's take a look at triangle $BDI$. Because $BI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle B$, by the angle bisector theorem, $\frac{AI}{ID} = \frac{BA}{BD} \implies \frac{h-r}{r} = \frac{a}{b}$. Rearranging, we get $r = \frac{hb}{a+b}$.

Take a look at triangle $AGI$. $AG = a - GB = a - BD = a-b$, $AI = h-r = \frac{ha}{a+b}$ (angle bisector theorem), and $GI = r = \frac{hb}{a+b}$. Now let's analyze triangle $AHI_A$. $AH = AB + BH = AB+ BD = a+b$, $AI_A = h+r_{I_A}$, and $HI_A = r_{I_A}$. Since $\angle GAI = \angle HAI_A$ and $\angle IGA = \angle I_AHA = 90^{\circ}$, triangle $AGI$ and $AHI_A$ are similar by AA. Then $\frac{r_{I_A}}{r} = \frac{h+r_{I_A}}{h-r} \implies r_{I_A} = r \cdot \frac{h+r_{I_A}}{h-r} = \frac{hb}{a+b} \cdot \frac{h+r_{I_A}}{\frac{ha}{a+b}} = \frac{b(h+r_{I_A})}{a}$. Now, solving yields $r_{I_A} = \frac{hb}{a-b}$.

Finally, the left hand side of our equation is\[\frac{2hb}{a-b} + \frac{hb}{a+b}\]
Now let's look at triangle $BFI_B$. How will we find $BI_B$? Let's first try to find $BF$ and $I_BF$ in terms of the lengths of the triangle. We recognize:

$BF = BC + CF = BC + CK$. We really want to have $CA$ instead of $CK$, and $AK$ looks very similar in length to $DC$, so let's try to prove that they are equal.

$BJ = BF$, so we can try to add these two and see if we get anything interesting. We have: $BJ + BF = BA + AJ + BC + CF = BA + AE + BC + CE = BA + BC + CA$, which is our perimeter. Thus, $BF = a+b$.

Triangle $BDI$ is similar to triangle $BFI_B$ by AA, and we know that $BD = b$, and $ID = r = \frac{hb}{a+b}$, so thus $I_BF = BF \cdot \frac{ID}{BD} = (a+b) \cdot \frac{\frac{hb}{a+b}}{b} = \frac{hb}{b} = h$. Thus, the height of this triangle is $h$ by similarity ratios, the same height as vertex $A$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BI_B = \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2}$ and by similarity ratios, $BI = \frac{b}{a+b} \cdot \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2}$. Finally, $r_{I_B} = I_BF = h$, and thus the right hand side of our equation is\[\sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2} - \frac{b}{a+b} \cdot \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2} - h = \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2}(1 - \frac{b}{a+b}) - h = \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2} \cdot \frac{a}{a+b} - h\].

Setting the two equal, we have\[\frac{2hb}{a-b} + \frac{hb}{a+b} = \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2} \cdot \frac{a}{a+b} - h\]
Multiplying both sides by $(a+b)(a-b)$ we have $2hb(a+b) + hb(a-b) = \sqrt{(a+b)^2 + h^2} \cdot a(a-b) - h(a^2 - b^2)$

From here, let $b = 1$ arbitrarily; note that we can always scale this value to fit the requirements later. Thus our equation is $2h(a+1) + h(a-1) = \sqrt{(a+1)^2 + h^2} \cdot a(a-1) - h(a^2 - 1)$. Now since $h = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$, we can plug into our equation:

$2h(a+1) + h(a-1) = \sqrt{a² + 2a + 1 + a^2 - b^2 } \cdot a(a-1) - h(a^2 - 1)$. Remembering $b = 1$;

$\implies 2h(a+1) + h(a-1) = \sqrt{2a^2 + 2a} \cdot a(a-1) - h(a^2 - 1)$

$\implies 3ha + h + ha^2 - h = \sqrt{2a^2 + 2a} \cdot a(a-1)$

$\implies ah(3+a) = a(a-1) \cdot \sqrt{2a^2 + 2a}$

$\implies h^2(3+a)^2 = (a-1)^2 \cdot 2a(a+1)$

$\implies (a^2 - 1) (3 + a)^2 = 2a(a+1)(a - 1)^2$

$\implies (3+ a)^2 = 2a(a-1)$

$\implies 9 + 6a + a^2 = 2a^2 - 2a$

$\implies a^2 - 8a - 9 = 0$

$\implies (a-9)(a+1) = 0$

$\implies a = 9$ because the side lengths have to be positive numbers. Furthermore, because our values for $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, we don't have to scale down our triangle further, and we are done. Therefore, our answer is $2a + 2b = 18 + 2 = \boxed{020}$","Notice that the $A$-excircle would have to be very small to fit the property that it is internally tangent to $\omega$ and the other two excircles are both externally tangent, given that circle $\omega$'s centre is at the incenter of $\triangle ABC$. If $BC=2$, we see that $AB=AC$ must be somewhere in the $6$ to $13$ range. If we test $6$ by construction, we notice the $A$-excircle is too big for it to be internally tangent to $\omega$ while the other two are externally tangent. This means we should test $8$ or $9$ next. I actually did this and found that $9$ worked, so the answer is $2+9+9=\boxed{20}$. Note that $BC$ cannot be $1$ because then $AB=AC$ would have to be $4.5$ which is not an integer.","Let $M$ be the midpoint $BC, BM = a, AB= BC = b,$ $s = b+a$ be the semiperimeter, $r$ be the inradius.

To prove this, note that when dividing two complex numbers you subtract the angle of one from the other. Therefore, if the two complex numbers are perpendicular, the difference between their arguments will be 90 degrees, so subtracting the angles will yield an imaginary number with no real part(an argument of 90 degrees puts a complex number on the imaginary axis).

Note that $\triangle GAC$ is similar to $\triangle GFD$. $GF = \frac{BG + 4}{3}$. Also note that $\triangle GBC$ is similar to $\triangle GFE$, which gives us $GF = \frac{7 \cdot BG}{5}$. Solving this system of linear equations, we get $BG = \frac{5}{4}$. Now, we can solve for $BE$, which is equal to $BG(\sqrt{2} + 1) + 4\sqrt{2}$. This simplifies to $\frac{5 + 21\sqrt{2}}{4}$, which means our answer is $\boxed{032}$","Construct $FC$ and let $FC\cap AE=K$. Let $FK=x$. Using $\triangle FKE\sim \triangle BKC$,\[BK=\frac{5}{7}x\]Using $\triangle FDK\sim ACK$, it can be found that\[3x=AK=4+\frac{5}{7}x\to x=\frac{7}{4}\]This also means that $BK=\frac{21}{4}-4=\frac{5}{4}$. It suffices to find $KE$. It is easy to see the following:\[180-\angle ABC=\angle KBC=\angle KFE\]Using reverse Law of Cosines on $\triangle ABC$, $\cos{\angle ABC}=\frac{1}{8}\to \cos{180-\angle ABC}=\frac{-1}{8}$. Using Law of Cosines on $\triangle EFK$ gives $KE=\frac{21\sqrt 2}{4}$, so $BE=\frac{5+21\sqrt 2}{4}\to \boxed{\textbf{032}}$","Let $P=AE\cap CF$. Let $CP=5x$ and $BP=5y$; from $\triangle{CBP}\sim\triangle{EFP}$ we have $EP=7x$ and $FP=7y$. From $\triangle{CAP}\sim\triangle{DFP}$ we have $\frac{6}{4+5y}=\frac{2}{7y}$ giving $y=\frac{1}{4}$. So $BP=\frac{5}{4}$ and $FP=\frac{7}{4}$. These similar triangles also gives us $DP=\frac{5}{3}x$ so $DE=\frac{16}{3}x$. Now, Stewart's Theorem on $\triangle{FEP}$ and cevian $FD$ tells us that\[\frac{560}{9}x^3+28x=\frac{49}{3}x+\frac{245}{3}x,\]so $x=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}$. Then $BE=\frac{5}{4}+7x=\frac{5+21\sqrt{2}}{4}$ so the answer is $\boxed{032}$","Connect $CF$ meeting $AE$ at $J$. We can observe that $\triangle{ACJ}\sim \triangle{FJD}$ Getting that $\frac{AJ}{FJ}=\frac{AC}{FD}=3$. We can also observe that $\triangle{CBJ}\sim \triangle{EFJ}$, getting that $\frac{CB}{EF}=\frac{BJ}{FJ}=\frac{CJ}{EJ}=\frac{5}{7}$

Assume that $BJ=5x;FJ=7x$, since $\frac{AJ}{FJ}=3$, we can get that $\frac{AJ}{FJ}=\frac{AB+BJ}{FJ}=\frac{4+5x}{7x}=3$, getting that $x=\frac{1}{4}; BJ=\frac{5}{4}; FJ=\frac{7}{4}$

Using Power of Point, we can get that $BJ * EJ=CJ*FJ; DJ * AJ=CJ * FJ$ Assume that $DJ=5k,CJ=15k$, getting that $JE=21k, DE=16k$

Now applying Law of Cosine on two triangles, $\triangle{ACJ};\triangle{FJE}$ separately, we can get two equations

$(1): (15k)^2+(\frac{21}{4})^2-2*15k *\frac{21}{4} * cos\angle{CJA}=36$

$(2):(21k)^2+(\frac{7}{4})^2-2*\frac{7}{4} * 21k*cos\angle{FJE}=49$

Since $\angle{CJA}=\angle{FJE}$, we can use $15(2)-7(1)$ to eliminate the $cos$ term

Then we can get that $5040k^2=630$, getting $k=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$

$BE=21k=\frac{21\sqrt{2}}{4}; BJ=\frac{5}{4}$, so the desired answer is $\frac{21\sqrt{2}+5}{4}$, which leads to the answer $\boxed{032}$"
7750,Find the least odd prime factor of $2019^8+1$,97,"We know that $2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$ for some prime $p$. We want to find the smallest odd possible value of $p$. By squaring both sides of the congruence, we find $2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

Since $2019^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is a positive divisor of $16$.

However, if the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $1, 2, 4,$ or $8,$ then $2019^8$ will be equivalent to $1 \pmod{p},$ which contradicts the given requirement that $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod{p}$.

Therefore, the order of $2019$ modulo $p$ is $16$. Because all orders modulo $p$ divide $\phi(p)$, we see that $\phi(p)$ is a multiple of $16$. As $p$ is prime, $\phi(p) = p\left(1 - \dfrac{1}{p}\right) = p - 1$. Therefore, $p\equiv 1 \pmod{16}$. The two smallest primes equivalent to $1 \pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. Because $16 | p - 1$, and $p - 1  \geq 16$, each possible value of $p$ must be verified by manual calculation to make sure that $p | 2019^8+1$. As $2019^8 \not\equiv -1 \pmod{17}$ and $2019^8 \equiv -1 \pmod{97}$, the smallest possible $p$ is thus $\boxed{097}$","In this solution, $k$ will represent an arbitrary nonnegative integer.

We will show that any potential prime $p$ must be of the form $16k+1$ through a proof by contradiction. Suppose that there exists some prime $p$ that can not be expressed in the form $16k+1$ that is a divisor of $2019^8+1$. First, note that if the prime $p$ is a divisor of $2019$, then $2019^8$ is a multiple of $p$ and $2019^8+1$ is not. Thus, $p$ is not a divisor of $2019$.

Because $2019^8+1$ is a multiple of $p$, $2019^8+1\equiv0\pmod{p}$. This means that $2019^8\equiv-1\pmod{p}$, and by raising both sides to an arbitrary odd positive integer, we have that $2019^{16k+8}\equiv-1\pmod{p}$.

Then, since the problem requires an odd prime, $p$ can be expressed as $16k+m$, where $m$ is an odd integer ranging from $3$ to $15$, inclusive. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2019^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod{p}$, and plugging in values, we get $2019^{16k+n}\equiv1\pmod{p}$, where $n=m-1$ and is thus an even integer ranging from $2$ to $14$, inclusive.

If $n=8$, then $2019^{16k+8}\equiv1\pmod{p}$, which creates a contradiction. If $n$ is not a multiple of $8$ but is a multiple of $4$, squaring both sides of $2019^{16k+n}\equiv1\pmod{p}$ also results in the same contradictory equivalence. For all remaining $n$, raising both sides of $2019^{16k+n}\equiv1\pmod{p}$ to the $4$th power creates the same contradiction. (Note that $32k$ and $64k$ can both be expressed in the form $16k$.)

Since we have proved that no value of $n$ can work, this means that a prime must be of the form $16k+1$ in order to be a factor of $2019^8+1$. The smallest prime of this form is $17$, and testing it, we get\[2019^8+1\equiv13^8+1\equiv169^4+1\equiv(-1)^4+1\equiv1+1\equiv2\pmod{17},\]so it does not work. The next smallest prime of the required form is $97$, and testing it, we get\[2019^8+1\equiv(-18)^8+1\equiv324^4+1\equiv33^4+1\equiv1089^2+1\equiv22^2+1\equiv484+1\equiv-1+1\equiv0\pmod{97},\]so it works. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{097}$","Suppose prime $p>2$ divides $2019^8+1.$ Then $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod p.$ Squaring gives $2019^{16}\equiv 1\pmod p.$ If $2019^m\equiv 1 \pmod p$ for some $0<m<16,$ it follows that\[2019^{\gcd(m,16)}\equiv 1\pmod p.\]But $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod p,$ so $\gcd(m,16)$ cannot divide $8,$ which is a contradiction. Thus $2019^{16}$ is the least positive power congruent to $1\pmod p.$ By Fermat's Little Theorem, $2019^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod p.$ It follows that $p=16k+1$ for some positive integer $k.$ The least two primes of this form are $17$ and $97.$ The least odd factor of $2019^8+1$ is not $17$ because\[2019\equiv 13\pmod{17}\qquad \text{and}\qquad 13^2\equiv 169\equiv -1\pmod{17},\]which implies $2019^8\equiv 1\not\equiv -1\pmod {17}.$ But $2019\equiv -18\pmod{97},$ so\begin{align*} (-18)^2=324&\equiv 33\pmod{97}, \\ 33^2=1089&\equiv 22\pmod{97},\,\text{and} \\ 22^2=484&\equiv -1\pmod{97}.\end{align*}Thus the least odd prime factor is $97.$","Let $n$ represent the least odd prime that the question is asking for.

We can see that $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod n.$

Squaring both sides we get $2019^{16}\equiv 1\pmod n.$

From Fermat's Little Theorem $a^{n-1}\equiv 1\pmod n$, we know that $n-1$ has to be a multiple of 16. So we want to test prime numbers that fit this.

The first prime we get is 17 and when we try it in $2019^8\equiv -1\pmod n,$

$2019^{8}\equiv 13^8\pmod {17}$

$169^{4}\equiv 16^4\pmod {17}$

$256^2\equiv 1\pmod {17}$

$1+1=2$

There is a homothety at $A$ sending $\omega$ to $\omega_1$ that sends $B$ to $P$ and $O$ to $O_1$, so $\overline{OO_2}\parallel\overline{O_1P}$. Similarly, $\overline{OO_1}\parallel\overline{O_2P}$, so $OO_1PO_2$ is a parallelogram. Moreover,\[\angle O_1QO_2=\angle O_1PO_2=\angle O_1OO_2,\]whence $OO_1O_2Q$ is cyclic. However,\[OO_1=O_2P=O_2Q,\]so $OO_1O_2Q$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Since $\overline{O_1O_2}\perp\overline{XY}$, $\overline{OQ}\perp\overline{XY}$, so $Q$ is the midpoint of $\overline{XY}$.

By Power of a Point, $PX\cdot PY=PA\cdot PB=15$. Since $PX+PY=XY=11$ and $XQ=11/2$,\[XP=\frac{11-\sqrt{61}}2\implies PQ=XQ-XP=\frac{\sqrt{61}}2\implies PQ^2=\frac{61}4,\]and the requested sum is $61+4=\boxed{065}$","Let the tangents to $\omega$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $R$.

By the Midpoint of Harmonic Bundles Lemma(EGMO 9.17),\[RP\cdot RQ'=RX\cdot RY=RA^2=RP\cdot RQ,\]whence $Q=Q'$. Like above, $XP=\tfrac{11-\sqrt{61}}2$. Since $XQ=\tfrac{11}2$, we establish that $PQ=\tfrac{\sqrt{61}}2$, from which $PQ^2=\tfrac{61}4$, and the requested sum is $61+4=\boxed{065}$.","Firstly we need to notice that $Q$ is the middle point of $XY$. Assume the center of circle $w, w_1, w_2$ are $O, O_1, O_2$, respectively. Then $A, O_1, O$ are collinear and $O, O_2, B$ are collinear. Link $O_1P, O_2P, O_1Q, O_2Q$. Notice that, $\angle B=\angle A=\angle APO_1=\angle BPO_2$. As a result, $PO_1\parallel O_2O$ and $OO_1\parallel O_2P$. So we have parallelogram $PO_2OO_1$. So $\angle O_2PO_1=\angle O$ Notice that, $O_1O_2\bot PQ$ and $O_1O_2$ divides $PQ$ into two equal length pieces, So we have $\angle O_2QO_1=\angle O_2PO_1=\angle O$. As a result, $O_2, Q, O, O_1,$ lie on one circle. So $\angle OQO_1=\angle OO_2O_1=\angle O_2O_1P$. Notice that since $\angle O_1PQ+\angle O_2O_1P=90^{\circ}$, we have $\angle OQP=\angle OQO_1 + \angle O_1QP = \angle O_2O_1P + O_1PQ=90^{\circ}$. As a result, $OQ\bot PQ$. So $Q$ is the middle point of $XY$.

Back to our problem. Assume $XP=x$, $PY=y$ and $x<y$. Then we have $AP\cdot PB=XP\cdot PY$, that is, $xy=15$. Also, $XP+PY=x+y=XY=11$. Solve these above, we have $x=\frac{11-\sqrt{61}}{2}=XP$. As a result, we have $PQ=XQ-XP=\frac{11}{2}-\frac{11-\sqrt{61}}{2}=\frac{\sqrt{61}}{2}$. So, we have $PQ^2=\frac{61}{4}$.

But if $O$ is the center of $\omega$, clearly $ZAOB$ is cyclic with diameter $ZO$, so $\angle ZQO = 90^{\circ}$ implies that $Q$ is the midpoint of $XY$. Then, by power of point $P$,\[PY \cdot PX = PA \cdot PB = 15,\]whereas it is given that $PY+PX = 11$. Thus\[PY, PX \in \left\{\tfrac 12 (11 \pm \sqrt{61})\right\}\]so $PQ = \frac{\sqrt{61}}{2}$, i.e. $PQ^2 = \frac{61}{4}$ and the answer is $61+4 = \boxed{065}$","Connect $AQ,QB$, since $\angle{AO_1P}=\angle{AOB}=\angle{BO_2P}$, so $\angle{AQP}=\frac{\angle{AO_1P}}{2}=\angle{BQP}=\frac{\angle{BO_2P}}{2}, \angle{AQB}=\angle{AOB}$ then, so $A,O,Q,B$ are concyclic

The probability that the product of all four numbers rolled is a perfect square is $\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",187,"Notice that, other than the number 5, the remaining numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are only divisible by 2 and/or 3. We can do some cases on the number of 5's rolled (note that there are $6^4 = 1296$ outcomes).

Case 1 (easy): Four 5's are rolled. This has probability $\frac{1}{6^4}$ of occurring.

Case 2: Two 5's are rolled.

Case 3: No 5's are rolled.

To find the number of outcomes for the latter two cases, we will use recursion. Consider a 5-sided die with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. For $n \ge 1$, let $a_n$ equal the number of outcomes after rolling the die $n$ times, with the property that the product is a square. Thus, $a_1 = 2$ as 1 and 4 are the only possibilities.

To find $a_{n+1}$ given $a_n$ (where $n \ge 1$), we observe that if the first $n$ rolls multiply to a perfect square, then the last roll must be 1 or 4. This gives $2a_n$ outcomes. Otherwise, the first $n$ rolls do not multiply to a perfect square ($5^n - a_n$ outcomes). In this case, we claim that the last roll is uniquely determined (either 2, 3, or 6). If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3. Thus, we have $5^n - a_n$ outcomes in this case, and $a_{n+1} = 2a_n + (5^n - a_n) = 5^n + a_n$.

Computing $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ gives $a_2 = 7$, $a_3 = 32$, and $a_4 = 157$. Thus for Case 3, there are 157 outcomes. For case 2, we multiply $a_2$ by $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ to distribute the two 5's among four rolls. Thus the probability is

\[\frac{1 + 6 \cdot 7 + 157}{6^4} = \frac{200}{6^4} = \frac{25}{162} \implies m+n = \boxed{187}\]","We can solve this without finding the amount of cases. Notice when we roll a 1 or a 4, it does not affect whether or not the product is a square number. We have a 1/3 chance of rolling either a 1 or 4. We have a 2/3 chance of rolling a 2,3,5 or 6. Let's call rolling 1 or 4 rolling a dud (a perfect square).

Probability of rolling 4 duds: $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4$

Probability of rolling 3 duds: $4 * \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 * \frac{2}{3}$

Probability of rolling 2 duds: $6 * \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 * \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$

Probability of rolling 1 dud: $4 * \frac{1}{3} * \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3$

Probability of rolling 0 duds: $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4$

Now we will find the probability of a square product given we have rolled each amount of duds

Probability of getting a square product given 4 duds: 1

Probability of getting a square product given 3 duds: 0 (you will have 1 non-dud and that's never going to be square)

Probability of getting a square product given 2 duds: $\frac{1}{4}$ (as long as our two non-duds are the same, our product will be square)

Probability of getting a square product given 1 dud: $\frac{3!}{4^3}$ = $\frac{3}{32}$ (the only way to have a square product is rolling a 2,3 and 6. There are 3! ways of doing that and a total of $4^3$ ways to roll 3 non-duds).

Probability of getting a square product given 0 duds: $\frac{40}{4^4}$= $\frac{5}{32}$ (We can have any two non-duds twice. For example, 2,2,5,5. There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways of choosing which two non-duds to use and $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways of choosing how to arrange those 4 numbers. That gives us 6*6=36 combinations. We can also have 2,2,2,2 or 3,3,3,3 or 5,5,5,5 or 6,6,6,6. This gives us a total of 40 combinations).

We multiply each probability of rolling k duds with the probability of getting a square product given k duds and then sum all the values.\[\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^4  * 1 + 4 * \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 * \frac{2}{3} * 0 + 6 * \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 * \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 * \frac{1}{4} + 4 * \frac{1}{3} * \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 * \frac{3}{32} + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4 * \frac{5}{32} = \frac{25}{162}.\]
$25+162$ = $\boxed{187}$","Note that rolling a 1/4 will not affect whether or not the product is a perfect square. This means that in order for the product to be a perfect square, all non 1/4 numbers rolled must come in pairs, with the only exception being the triplet 2,3, 6. Now we can do casework:

If there are four 1/4's, then there are $2^4=16$ combinations. If there are three 1/4's, then there are 0 combinations, because the fourth number isn't a square. If there are two 1/4's, there are $2^2=4$ ways to choose the two 1/4's, 4 ways to choose the remaining pair of numbers, and $\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways to arrange, so there are $4\cdot 4\cdot 6=96$ combinations for this case. If there is one 1/4, then there are 2 ways to choose whether it is a 1 or 4, and the remaining three numbers must be 2, 3, and 6, so there are $4!$ ways to order, meaning there are $2\cdot 4!=48$ combinations for this case. Our final case is if there are no 1/4's, in which case we must have two pairs. If the two pairs are of different numbers, then there $\binom{4}{2}$ to choose the numbers and $\frac{4!}{2!2!}=6$ ways to arrange them, so $6\cdot 6=36$. If all four numbers are the same there are $4$ combinations, so there are $4+36=40$ combinations for this case.

Hence there are $16+0+96+48+40=200$ combinations where the product of the dice is a perfect square, and there are $6^4=1296$ total combinations, so the desired probability is $\frac{200}{1296}=\frac{25}{162}$, yielding an answer of $25+162=\boxed{187}$.","Another way to solve this problem is to do casework on all the perfect squares from $1^2$ to $36^2$, and how many ways they can be ordered $1^2$- $1,1,1,1$- $1$ way. $2^2$- $4,1,1,1$ or $2,2,1,1$- $\binom{4}{2}+4=10$ ways. $3^2$- $3,3,1,1$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $4^2$- $4,4,1,1$, $2,2,2,2$, or $2,2,4,1$- $\binom{4}{2}+1+12=19$ ways. $5^2$- $5,5,1,1$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $6^2$- $6,6,1,1$, $1,2,3,6$, $2,3,2,3$, $3,3,4,1$- $2*\binom{4}{2}+4!+12=48$ ways. $7^2$- Since there is a prime greater than 6 in its prime factorization there are $0$ ways. $8^2$- $4,4,4,1$ or $2,4,2,4$- $\binom{4}{2}+4=10$ ways. $9^2$- $3,3,3,3$- $1$ way. $10^2$- $2,2,5,5$ or $1,4,5,5$- $6+12=18$ ways. $11^2$- $0$ ways for the same reason as $7^2$. $12^2$- $6,6,2,2$, $4,4,3,3$, $2,3,4,6$, or $1,4,6,6$- $2*\binom{4}{2}+4!+12=48$ ways. $13^2$- $0$ ways. $14^2$- $0$ ways. $15^2$- $3,3,5,5$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $16^2$- $4,4,4,4$- $1$ way. $17^2$- $0$ ways. $18^2$- $3,3,6,6$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $19^2$- $0$ ways. $20^2$- $4,4,5,5$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $21^2$- $0$ ways. $22^2$- $0$ ways. $23^2$- $0$ ways. $24^2$-$4,4,6,6$- $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. $25^2$- $5,5,5,5$- $1$ way. $26^2$- $0$ ways. $27^2$- $0$ ways. $28^2$- $0$ ways. $29^2$- $0$ ways. $30^2$- $5,5,6,6$- $\binom{4}{2}$ ways. $31^2$- $0$ ways. $32^2$- $0$ ways. $33^2$- $0$ ways. $34^2$- $0$ ways. $35^2$- $0$ ways. $36^2$- $6,6,6,6$- $1$ way.

There are $6^4=1296$ ways that the dice can land. Summing up the ways, it is easy to see that there are $200$ ways. This results in a probability of $\frac{200}{1296}=\frac{25}{162}\implies\boxed{187}$","We can do recursion on the number of rolls to find the number of ways we can get $4$ rolls to multiply to a square.

After $n$ rolls, let us say that the product is $p = 2^a3^b5^c$.

Define the following:

$A_{n} =$ the number of ways to have a product after $n$ rolls where $a$ is odd, and $b$, $c$ are even

$B_{n} =$ the number of ways to have a product after $n$ rolls where $b$ is odd, and $a$, $c$ are even

$C_{n} =$ the number of ways to have a product after $n$ rolls where $c$ is odd, and $a$, $b$ are even

$S_{n} =$ the number of ways to have a product after $n$ rolls where $a, b,$ and $c$ are all even (square!)

We have the following equations after considering the possible values of the nth roll:

\[A_{n} = S_{n-1}+B_{n-1}+D_{n-1}+E_{n-1}+2A_{n-1}\]
\[B_{n} = A_{n-1}+D_{n-1}+F_{n-1}+S_{n-1}+2B_{n-1}\]

\[S_{n} = A_{n-1}+C_{n-1}+B_{n-1}+D_{n-1}+2S_{n-1}\]
We have the following values after considering the possible values of the 1st roll:

\[A_1 = B_1 = C_1 = D_1 = 1; E_1 = F_1 = G_1 = 0; S_1 = 2\]
After applying recursion twice, we get:

\[A_2 = B_2 = D_2 = 6, C_2 = 4, E_2 = F_2 = G_2 = 2, S_2 = 8\]
\[A_3 = B_3 = D_3 = 34, C_3 = 22, E_3 = F_3 = G_3 = 18, S_3 = 38\]

7756,Four ambassadors and one advisor for each of them are to be seated at a round table with $12$ chairs numbered in order $1$ to $12$. Each ambassador must sit in an even-numbered chair. Each advisor must sit in a chair adjacent to his or her ambassador. There are $N$ ways for the $8$ people to be seated at the table under these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.,520,"Let us first consider the $4$ ambassadors and the $6$ even-numbered chairs. If we consider only their relative positions, they can sit in one of $3$ distinct ways: Such that the $2$ empty even-numbered chairs are adjacent, such that they are separated by one occupied even-numbered chair, and such that they are opposite each other. For each way, there are $4!=24$ ways to assign the $4$ ambassadors to the $4$ selected seats.

In the first way, there are $6$ distinct orientations. The $4$ advisors can be placed in any of the $5$ odd-numbered chairs adjacent to the ambassadors, and for each placement, there is exactly one way to assign them to the ambassadors. This means that there are $24\cdot6\cdot\binom{5}{4}=720$ total seating arrangements for this way.

In the second way, there are $6$ distinct orientations. $3$ advisors can be placed in any of the $4$ chairs adjacent to the ""chunk"" of $3$ ambassadors, and $1$ advisor can be placed in either of the $2$ chairs adjacent to the ""lonely"" ambassador. Once again, for each placement, there is exactly one way to assign the advisors to the ambassadors. This means that there are $24\cdot6\cdot\binom{4}{3}\cdot\binom{2}{1}=1152$ total seating arrangements for this way.

In the third way, there are $3$ distinct orientations. For both ""chunks"" of $2$ ambassadors, $2$ advisors can be placed in any of the $3$ chairs adjacent to them, and once again, there is exactly one way to assign them for each placement. This means that there are $24\cdot3\cdot\binom{3}{2}\cdot\binom{3}{2}=648$ total seating arrangements for this way.

Totalling up the arrangements, there are $720+1152+648=2520$ total ways to seat the people, and the remainder when $2520$ is divided by $1000$ is $\boxed{520}$.","In the diagram, the seats are numbered 1...12. Rather than picking seats for each person, however, each ambassador/assistant team picks a gap between the seats (A...L) and the ambassador sits in the even seat while the assistant sits in the odd seat. For example, if team 1 picks gap C then Ambassador 1 will sit in seat 2 while assistant 1 will sit in seat 3. No two teams can pick adjacent gaps. For example, if team 1 chooses gap C then team 2 cannot pick gaps B or D. In the diagram, the teams have picked gaps C, F, H and J. Note that the gap-gaps - distances between the chosen gaps - (in the diagram, 2, 1, 1, 4) must sum to 8. So, to get the number of seatings, we:

Choose a gap for team 1 ($12$ options)
Choose 3 other gaps around the table with positive gap-gaps. Note that because the sum of the distances between the gaps must be equal to $8,$ we create a bijection - to partition the 8 balls into 4 urns, with each urn having a positive number of balls. There is the same as partitioning 4 with 4 non-negative integers, and using stars-and-bars, this is $\dbinom{4+4-1}{4-1}=\dbinom{7}{3}=35$
Place the other 3 teams in the chosen gaps ($6$ permutations)
So, the total is $12\cdot35\cdot6=2520$.

Therefore, the remainder is $\boxed{520}$.","There are $6\cdot5\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2^4$ (placing the ambassadors and then choosing the locations of the advisors) total ways to let everyone sit. However, this may lead to advisors sitting in the same chair, leading to awkward situations. So we find how many ways this happens. There are $\dbinom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose which advisors end up sitting together, times $6\cdot2=12$ ways to find neighboring even seats (order matters), and for the other two ambassadors, there are $\dbinom{4}{2} \cdot 2 = 12$ ways to sit and 4 ways for their advisors to sit. This results in $6\cdot12\cdot12\cdot4=3456$ ways for this to happen. However, we overcounted the case when all four of the advisors run out of room to sit, where there are $\frac{6\cdot3}{2!}=9$ to choose the places the ambassadors sit and 4! ways to arrange the ambassadors. $9\cdot4!=216$ ways to happen. So the answer is $5760 - 3456 + 216 = 2520$, which has a remainder of $\boxed{520}$ ","We see that for every 2 adjacent spots on the table, there is exactly one way for an ambassador and his or her partner to sit. There are 2 cases:

There is an ambassador at the 12th chair and his or her partner at the 1st chair
There is no pair that has their chairs numbered as 12 and 1
For the first case, there are 3 pairs and 4 empty spaces, which results in $\frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35$ ways to arrange the pairs.

For the second case, there are 4 pairs and 4 empty spaces, which results in $\frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70$ ways to arrange the pairs.

Finally, we have to assign ambassadors and their advisors to the pairs, which has $4!=24$ ways, so $N = (35+70)\cdot 24 = 2520$, or $\boxed{520}$",no more solutions explained

We wish to find $f(1) = a+b+c$. We first look at the real parts. As $\text{Re}(\omega^2) = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $\text{Re}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2}$, we have $-\frac{1}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}b + c = 2015 \implies -a+b + 2c = 4030$. Looking at imaginary parts, we have $\text{Im}(\omega^2) = \text{Im}(\omega) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}(a+b) = 2019\sqrt{3} \implies a+b = 4038$. As $a$ and $b$ do not exceed 2019, we must have $a = 2019$ and $b = 2019$. Then $c = \frac{4030}{2} = 2015$, so $f(1) = 4038 + 2015 = 6053 \implies f(1) \pmod{1000} = \boxed{053}$","Denote $\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2}$ with $\omega$.

By using the quadratic formula ($\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$) in reverse, we can find that $\omega$ is the solution to a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ such that $2a=2$, $-b=1$, and $b^2-4ac=-3$. This clearly solves to $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=1$, so $\omega$ solves $x^2-x+1=0$.

Multiplying $x^2-x+1=0$ by $x+1$ on both sides yields $x^3+1=0$. Muliplying this by $x^3-1$ on both sides yields $x^6-1=0$, or $x^6=1$. This means that $\omega^6=1$.

We can use this to simplify the equation $a\omega^{2018}+b\omega^{2017}+c\omega^{2016}=f(\omega)=2015+2019\sqrt{3}i$ to $a\omega^2+b\omega+c=2015+2019\sqrt{3}i.$

As in Solution 1, we use the values $\omega=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2=-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ to find that $-\frac{1}{2}a+\frac{1}{2}b+c=2015$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}b=2019\sqrt{3} \implies a+b=4038.$ Since neither $a$ nor $b$ can exceed $2019$, they must both be equal to $2019$. Since $a$ and $b$ are equal, they cancel out in the first equation, resulting in $c=2015$.

Therefore, $f(1)=a+b+c=2019+2019+2015=6053$, and $6053\bmod1000=\boxed{053}$","Calculate the first few powers of $\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2}$.

Since 2016 is a multiple of 6, $(\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})^{2016}=1$

$f(\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})=a(\frac{-1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})+b(\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})+c$

$f(\frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2})=(-\frac{1}{2}a+\frac{1}{2}b+c)+(\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}a+\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}b)=2015+2019\sqrt{3}i$

Therefore, $-\frac{1}{2}a+\frac{1}{2}b+c=2015$ and $\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}a+\frac{\sqrt{3}i}{2}b=2019\sqrt{3}i$

Using the first equation, we can get that $-a+b+2c=4030$, and using the second equation, we can get that $a+b=4038$.

Since all coefficients are less than or equal to $2019$, $a=b=2019$.

Therefore, $2c=4030$ and $c=2015$.

Let $S$ be the sum of positive integers less than $2019$ that are $20$-pretty. Find $\tfrac{S}{20}$.",472,"Every 20-pretty integer can be written in form $n = 2^a 5^b k$, where $a \ge 2$, $b \ge 1$, $\gcd(k,10) = 1$, and $d(n) = 20$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Thus, we have $20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k)$, using the fact that the divisor function is multiplicative. As $(a+1)(b+1)$ must be a divisor of 20, there are not many cases to check.

If $a+1 = 4$, then $b+1 = 5$. But this leads to no solutions, as $(a,b) = (3,4)$ gives $2^3 5^4 > 2019$.

If $a+1 = 5$, then $b+1 = 2$ or $4$. The first case gives $n = 2^4 \cdot 5^1 \cdot p$ where $p$ is a prime other than 2 or 5. Thus we have $80p < 2019 \implies p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$. The sum of all such $n$ is $80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440$. In the second case $b+1 = 4$ and $d(k) = 1$, and there is one solution $n = 2^4 \cdot 5^3 = 2000$.

If $a+1 = 10$, then $b+1 = 2$, but this gives $2^9 \cdot 5^1 > 2019$. No other values for $a+1$ work.

Then we have $\frac{S}{20} = \frac{80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) + 2000}{20} = 372 + 100 = \boxed{472}$","For $n$ to have exactly $20$ positive divisors, $n$ can only take on certain prime factorization forms: namely, $p^{19}, p^9q, p^4q^3, p^4qr$ where $p,q,r$ are primes. No number that is a multiple of $20$ can be expressed in the first form because 20 has two primes in its prime factorization, while the first form has only one, and the only integer divisible by $20$ that has the second form is $2^{9}5$, which is 2560, greater than $2019$.

For the third form, the only $20$-pretty numbers are $2^45^3=2000$ and $2^35^4=5000$, and only $2000$ is small enough.

For the fourth form, any number of the form $2^45r$ where $r$ is a prime other than $2$ or $5$ will satisfy the $20$-pretty requirement. Since $n=80r<2019$, $r\le 25$. Therefore, $r$ can take on $3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,$ or $23$.

Thus, $\frac{S}{20}=\frac{2000+80(3+7+11+...+23)}{20}=100+4(3+7+11+...+23)=\boxed{472}$","The divisors of $20$ are ${1,2,4,5,10,20}$. $v_2(n)$ must be $\ge 2$ because $20=2^2 \times 5$. This means that $v_2(n)$ can be exactly $3$ or $4$. Because greater exponents of 2 (like $2^9\cdot5$) gives numbers greater than 2019, so we just have the cases below.

1. $v_2(n) = 3$. Then $\frac{20}{4}=5=5\times 1$. The smallest is $2^3*5^4$ which is $> 2019$. Hence there are no solution in this case.

2. $v_2(n)=4$. Then $\frac{20}{5}=4 = 4\times 1 = 2\times 2$. The $4\times 1$ case gives one solution, $2^4 \times 5^3 = 2000$. The $2\times 2$ case gives $2^4\times 5 \times (3+7+11+13+17+19+23)$.Using any prime greater than $23$ will make $n$ greater than $2019$.

Find $p+q$.",547,"Note that if $\tan \theta$ is positive, then $\theta$ is in the first or third quadrant, so $0^{\circ} < \theta < 90^{\circ} \pmod{180^{\circ}}$.

Furthermore, the only way $\tan{\left(2^{n}\theta\right)}$ can be positive for all $n$ that are multiples of $3$ is when:\[2^0\theta \equiv 2^3\theta \equiv 2^6\theta \equiv ... \pmod{180^{\circ}}.\](This is because if it isn't the same value, the terminal angle will gradually shift from the first quadrant into different quadrants, making the condition for positive tan untrue. This must also be true in order for $\theta$ to be unique.)

This is the case if $2^3\theta \equiv 2^0\theta \pmod{180^{\circ}}$, so $7\theta \equiv 0^{\circ} \pmod{180^{\circ}}$. Therefore, recalling that $0^{\circ}<\theta<90^{\circ},$ the possible $\theta$ are:\[\frac{180}{7}^{\circ}, \frac{360}{7}^{\circ}, \frac{540}{7}^{\circ}.\]
$\frac{180}{7}^{\circ}$ does not work since $\tan\left(2 \cdot \frac{180}{7}^{\circ}\right)$ is positive.

$\frac{360}{7}^{\circ}$ does not work because $\tan\left(4 \cdot \frac{360}{7}^{\circ}\right)$ is positive.

Thus, $\theta = \frac{540}{7}^{\circ}$, and a quick check verifies that it does work. Our desired answer is $540 + 7 = \boxed{547}$","As in the previous solution, we note that $\tan \theta$ is positive when $\theta$ is in the first or third quadrant.

We already know that $\theta\in(0,90)$. We can keep track of the range of $2^n\theta$ for each $n$ by considering the portion in the desired quadrants, which gives\[n=1 \implies (90,180)\]\[n=2\implies (270,360)\]\[n=3 \implies (180,270)\]\[n=4 \implies (90,180)\]\[n=5\implies(270,360)\]\[n=6 \implies (180,270)\]\[\cdots\]at which point we realize a pattern emerging. Specifically, the intervals repeat every $3$ after $n=1$. We can use these repeating intervals to determine the desired value of $\theta$ since the upper and lower bounds will converge to such a value (since it is unique, as indicated in the problem). Let's keep track of the lower bound.

Initially, the lower bound is $0$ (at $n=0$), then increases to $\frac{90}{2}=45$ at $n=1$. This then becomes $45+\frac{45}{2}$ at $n=2$, $45+\frac{45}{2}$ at $n=3$, $45+\frac{45}{2}+\frac{45}{2^3}$ at $n=4$, $45+\frac{45}{2}+\frac{45}{2^3}+\frac{45}{2^4}$ at $n=5$, etc. Due to the observed pattern of the intervals, the lower bound follows a partial geometric series. Hence, as $n$ approaches infinity, the lower bound converges to\[\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(45+\frac{45}{2}\right)\cdot \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^k=\frac{45+\frac{45}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{8}}=\frac{\frac{135}{2}}{\frac{7}{8}}=\frac{540}{7}\implies p+q=540+7=\boxed{547}\]","Since $\tan\left(\theta\right) > 0$, $0 < \theta < 90$. Since $\tan\left(2\theta\right) < 0$, $\theta$ has to be in the second half of the interval (0, 90) ie (45, 90). Since $\tan\left(4\theta\right) < 0$, $\theta$ has to be in the second half of that interval ie (67.5, 90). And since $\tan\left(8\theta\right) > 0$, $\theta$ has to be in the first half of (67.5, 90). Inductively, the pattern repeats: $\theta$ is in the second half of the second half of the first half of the second half of the second half... of the interval (0, 90). Consider the binary representation of numbers in the interval (0, 1). Numbers in the first half of the interval start with 0.0... and numbers in the second half start with 0.1... . Similarly, numbers in the second half of the second half start with 0.11... etc. So if we want a number in the first half of the second half of the second half... of the interval, we want its binary representation to be $0.11011011011..._2 = \frac{6}{7}_{10}$. So we want the number which is 6/7 of the way through the interval (0, 90) so $\theta = \frac{6}{7}\cdot 90 = \frac{540}{7}$ and $p+q = 540 + 7 = \boxed{547}$","With some simple arithmetic and guess and check, we can set the lower bound and upper bounds for the ""first round of $3$ powers of two"", which are $\frac{540}{8} = 67.5$ and $\frac{630}{8} = 78.75$. Going on to the ""second round of $3$ powers of two, we set the new lower and upper bounds as $\frac{360 \times 12.5}{64} = 70.3125$ and $\frac{360 \times 13.75}{64} = 77.34375$ using some guess and check and bashing. Now, it is obvious that the bounds for the ""zeroth round of $3$ powers of two"" are $0$ and $90$, and notice that $90 - 78.75 = 11.25$ and $78.75 - 77.34375 = 1.40625$ and $\frac{11.25}{1.40625} = 8$. This is obviously a geometric series, so setting $11.25$ as $u$, we obtain $90 - (u + \frac{u}{8} + \frac{u}{64} + ...)$ = $90 - \frac{u}{1-\frac{1}{8}}$ = $\frac{u}{\frac{7}{8}}$ = $\frac{45}{4} \times \frac{8}{7}$ which simplifies to $\frac{90}{7}$.

In order to get to the Law of Cosines first, we first apply the LOC to $\triangle{ABC},$ obtaining $\angle{BAC}.$
We angle chase before applying the law of cosines to $\angle{AKB}.$

Now we know that $\angle O_{1}AO_{2}=180^{\circ}-x.$ Thus using law of cosines on $\bigtriangleup O_{1}AO_{2}$ yields\[O_{1}O_{2} =\sqrt{\left(\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}}\right)^2+\left(\frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}}\right)^2-2\:\cdot \left(\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}}\right)\cdot \frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}}\cdot -\frac{11}{21}}\]While this does look daunting we can write the above expression as\[\sqrt{\left(\frac{189+147}{16\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 - 2\cdot \left(\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}}\right)\cdot \frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}}\cdot \frac{10}{21}} =\sqrt{\left(\frac{168}{8\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{7 \cdot 189 \cdot 5}{8 \sqrt{5} \cdot 8\sqrt{5}}\right)}\]Then factoring yields\[\sqrt{\frac{21^2(8^2-15)}{(8\sqrt{5})^2}} =\frac{147}{8\sqrt{5}}\]The area\[[O_{1}AO_{2}] =\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot\frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot \sin(180^{\circ}-x) =\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot\frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot\frac{8\sqrt{5}}{21}\]Now $AK$ is twice the length of the altitude of $\bigtriangleup O_{1}AO_{2}$ so we let the altitude be $h$ and we have\[\frac{1}{2} \cdot h \cdot\frac{147}{8\sqrt{5}} =\frac{1}{2} \cdot\frac{147}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot\frac{189}{16\sqrt{5}} \cdot\frac{8\sqrt{5}}{21}\]\[\implies h =\frac{9}{4}\]Thus our desired length is $\frac{9}{2} \implies m+n = \boxed{11}.$","We start by assigning coordinates to point $A$, labeling it $(0,0)$ and point $B$ at $(7,0)$, and letting point $C$ be above the $x$-axis. Through an application of the Pythagorean Theorem and dropping an altitude to side $AB$, it is easy to see that $C$ has coordinates $(33/7, 24\sqrt{5}/7)$.

Let $O1$ be the center of circle $\omega_1$ and $O2$ be the center of circle $\omega_2$. Since circle $\omega_1$ contains both points $A$ and $B$, $O1$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of line $AB$, and similarly $O2$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of line $AC$. Through some calculations, we find that the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ has equation $x = 3.5$, and the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ has equation $y = {-11\sqrt{5}/40 \cdot x} + 189\sqrt{5}/80$.

Since circle $\omega_1$ is tangent to line $AC$ at $A$, its radius must be perpendicular to $AC$ at $A$. Therefore, the radius has equation $y = {{-11\cdot\sqrt{5}/40} \cdot x}$. Substituting the $x$-coordinate of $O1$ into this, we find the y-coordinate of $O1 = {{-11 \cdot \sqrt{5}/40} \cdot 7/2} = {-77 \cdot \sqrt{5}/80}$.

Similarly, since circle $\omega_2$ is tangent to line $AB$ at $A$, its radius must be perpendicular to $AB$ at $A$. Therefore, the radius has equation $x = 0$ and combining with the previous result for $O2$ we get that the coordinates of $O2$ are $(0, 189\sqrt{5}/80)$.

We now find the slope of $O1O2$, the line joining the centers of circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, which turns out to be ${({266 \cdot \sqrt{5} / 80}) \cdot -2/7} = {-19 \cdot \sqrt{5}/20}$. Since the $y$-intercept of that line is at $O2(0,189\sqrt{5}/80)$, the equation is $y = {{-19 \cdot \sqrt{5}/20} \cdot x} + {189 \cdot \sqrt{5}/80}$. Since circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $K$, line $AK$ is the radical axis of those circles, and since the radical axis is always perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the circles, $AK$ has slope ${4 \cdot \sqrt{5}/19}$. Since point $A$ is $(0,0)$, this line has a $y$-intercept of $0$, so it has equation $y$ = ${{4 \cdot \sqrt{5}/19} \cdot x}$.

We set ${{4 \cdot \sqrt{5}/19} \cdot x} = {{-19 \cdot \sqrt{5}/20} \cdot x} + {189 \cdot \sqrt{5}/80}$ in order to find the intersection $I$ of the radical axis $AK$ and $O1O2$. Through some moderate bashing, we find that the intersection point is $I(57/28, {3 \cdot \sqrt{5}/7})$. We know that either intersection point of two circles is the same distance from the intersection of radical axis and line joining the centers of those circles, so reflecting $A$ over $I$ yields $K$ and $AK$ = $2AI$ = (This is the most tedious part of the bash) ${2 \cdot \sqrt{(57/28)^2 + ({3 \cdot \sqrt{5}/7)^2)}}} = {2 \cdot \sqrt{3969/784}} = {2 \cdot 63/28} = {2 \cdot 9/4} = 9/2$. Therefore the answer is $9 + 2 = \boxed{011}.$"

Find the number of progressive sequences such that the sum of the terms in the sequence is equal to $360$",47,"If the first term is $x$, then dividing through by $x$, we see that we can find the number of progressive sequences whose sum is $\frac{360}{x} - 1$, and whose first term is not 1. If $a(k)$ denotes the number of progressive sequences whose sum is $k$ and whose first term is not 1, then we can express the answer $N$ as follows:

\begin{align*}N &= a(359) + a(179) + a(119) + a(89) + a(71) + a(59) + a(44) + a(39) \\ &+ a(35) + a(29) + a(23) + a(19) + a(17) + a(14) + a(11) + a(9) \\ &+ a(8) + a(7) + a(5) + a(4) + a(3) + a(2) + a(1) + 1 \end{align*}
The $+1$ at the end accounts for the sequence whose only term is 360. Fortunately, many of these numbers are prime; we have $a(p) = 1$ for primes $p$ as the only such sequence is ""$p$"" itself. Also, $a(1) = 0$. So we have

\[N = 15 + a(119) + a(44) + a(39) + a(35) + a(14) + a(9) + a(8) + a(4)\]
For small $k$, $a(k)$ is easy to compute: $a(4) = 1$, $a(8) = 2$, $a(9) = 2$. For intermediate $k$ (e.g. $k=21$ below), $a(k)$ can be computed recursively using previously-computed values of $a(\cdot)$, similar to dynamic programming. Then we have\begin{align*} a(14) &= 1+a(6) = 1+2 = 3\\ a(35) &= 1+a(6)+a(4) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \\ a(39) &= 2 + a(12) = 2+4 = 6 \\ a(44) &= 2 + a(21) + a(10) = 2+4+2=8 \\ a(119) &= 1 + a(16) + a(6) = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 \end{align*}Thus the answer is $N = 15+6+8+6+4+3+2+2+1 = \boxed{47}$",no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained

Define one arbitrary unit as the distance that you need to move $P$ from $A_1A_2$ to change the area of $\triangle PA_1A_2$ by $1$. We can see that $P$ was moved down by $\tfrac{1}{7}-\tfrac{1}{8}=\tfrac{1}{56}$ units to make the area defined by $P$, $A_1$, and $A_2$ $\tfrac{1}{7}$. Similarly, $P$ was moved right by $\tfrac{1}{8}-\tfrac{1}{9}=\tfrac{1}{72}$ to make the area defined by $P$, $A_3$, and $A_4$ $\tfrac{1}{9}$. This means that $P$ has coordinates $(\tfrac{1}{72},-\tfrac{1}{56})$.

Now, we need to consider how this displacement in $P$ affected the area defined by $P$, $A_6$, and $A_7$. This is equivalent to finding the shortest distance between $P$ and the blue line in the diagram (as $K=\tfrac{1}{2}bh$ and the blue line represents $h$ while $b$ is fixed). Using an isosceles right triangle, one can find the that shortest distance between $P$ and this line is $\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\tfrac{1}{56}-\tfrac{1}{72})=\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{504}$.

Remembering the definition of our unit, this yields a final area of\[\frac{1}{8}-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\boxed{504}}.\]",no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained
7765,"Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that, given an unlimited supply of stamps of denominations $5,n,$ and $n+1$ cents, $91$ cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed.",71,"By the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of $n$ such that $91$ cents cannot be formed satisfies $5n - (5 + n) = 91 \implies n = 24$, so $n$ must be at least $24$.

For a value of $n$ to work, we must not only be unable to form the value $91$, but we must also be able to form the values $92$ through $96$, as with these five values, we can form any value greater than $96$ by using additional $5$ cent stamps.

Notice that we must form the value $96$ without forming the value $91$. If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$. This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.

Recalling that $n \geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over. The potential sets are $(24, 25), (31, 32), (32, 33), (47, 48), (48, 49), (95, 96)$, and $(96, 97)$.

The last two obviously do not work, since they are too large to form the values $92$ through $95$. By a little testing, only $(24, 25)$ and $(47, 48)$ can form the necessary values, so $n \in \{24, 47\}$. $24 + 47 = \boxed{071}$","Notice that once we hit all residues $\bmod 5$, we'd be able to get any number greater (since we can continually add $5$ to each residue). Furthermore, $n\not\equiv 0,1\pmod{5}$ since otherwise $91$ is obtainable (by repeatedly adding $5$ to either $n$ or $n+1$) Since the given numbers are $5$, $n$, and $n+1$, we consider two cases: when $n\equiv 4\pmod{5}$ and when $n$ is not that.

When $n\equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, we can only hit all residues $\bmod 5$ once we get to $4n$ (since $n$ and $n+1$ only contribute $1$ more residue $\bmod 5$). Looking at multiples of $4$ greater than $91$ with $n\equiv 4\pmod{5}$, we get $n=24$. It's easy to check that this works. Furthermore, any $n$ greater than this does not work since $91$ isn't the largest unobtainable value (can be verified using Chicken McNugget Theorem).

Now, if $n\equiv 2,3\pmod{5}$, then we'd need to go up to $2(n+1)=2n+2$ until we can hit all residues $\bmod 5$ since $n$ and $n+1$ create $2$ distinct residues $\bmod{5}$. Checking for such $n$ gives $n=47$ and $n=48$. It's easy to check that $n=47$ works, but $n=48$ does not (since $92$ is unobtainable). Furthermore, any $n$ greater than this does not work since $91$ isn't the largest unobtainable value in those cases (can be verified using Chicken McNugget Theorem). (Also note that in the $3 \pmod{5}$ case, the residue $2 \pmod{5}$ has will not be produced until $3(n+1)$ while the $1\pmod5$ case has already been produced, so the highest possible value that cannot be produced would not be a number equivalent to $1 \pmod5$)

Since we've checked all residues $\bmod 5$, we can be sure that these are all the possible values of $n$. Hence, the answer is $24+47=\boxed{071}$.","Obviously $n\le 90$. We see that the problem's condition is equivalent to: 96 is the smallest number that can be formed which is 1 mod 5, and 92, 93, 94 can be formed (95 can always be formed). Now divide this up into cases. If $n\equiv 0\pmod{5}$, then 91 can be formed by using $n+1$ and some 5's, so there are no solutions for this case. If $n\equiv 1\pmod{5}$, then 91 can be formed by using $n$ and some 5's, so there are no solutions for this case either.

For $n\equiv 2\pmod{5}$, $2n+2$ is the smallest value that can be formed which is 1 mod 5, so $2n+2=96$ and $n=47$. We see that $92=45+47$, $93=48+45$, and $94=47+47$, so $n=47$ does work. If $n\equiv 3\pmod{5}$, then the smallest value that can be formed which is 1 mod 5 is $2n$, so $2n=96$ and $n=48$. We see that $94=49+45$ and $93=48+45$, but 92 cannot be formed, so there are no solutions for this case. If $n\equiv 4\pmod{5}$, then we can just ignore $n+1$ since it is a multiple of 5, meaning that the Chicken McNuggest theorem is a both necessary and sufficient condition, and it states that $5n-n-5=91$ meaning $4n=96$ and $n=24$. Hence, the only two $n$ that work are $n=24$ and $n=47$, so our answer is $24+47=\boxed{071}$.",no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained

Let $E$ and $F$ denote the reflections of the orthocenter over points $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Since $EF \parallel XY$ and\[EF = 2 PQ = XP + PQ + QY = XY,\]we have that $E X Y F$ is a rectangle.

Similarly, we can obtain $YC \parallel AB$. $\ \blacksquare$

A direct result of this claim is that $\triangle BPX \sim \triangle APQ \sim \triangle CYQ$.

Thus, we can set $AP = 5k$ and $BP = 2k$, then applying Power of a Point on $P$ we get $10 \cdot 40 = 10k^2 \implies k = 2\sqrt{10} \implies AB = 14 \sqrt{10}$. Also, we can set $AQ = 5l$ and $CQ = 3l$ and once again applying Power of a Point (but this time to $Q$) we get

Then\[\angle DBE = x - \angle CBD = x - (180^\circ - 2x) =  3x - 180^\circ\!.\]Because $\triangle EDA$ and $\triangle DBE$ are also isosceles,\[\angle BAC =\frac12(\angle EAD + \angle ADE) = \frac12(\angle BED)= \frac12(\angle DBE)\]\[= \frac12 (3x - 180^\circ) = \frac32x-90^\circ\!.\]Because $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $\angle BAC$ is also $180^\circ-2x$, so $\frac32x - 90^\circ = 180^\circ - 2x$, and it follows that $\angle ABC = x = \left(\frac{540}7\right)^\circ$. The requested sum is $540+7 = 547$.
","We write equations based on the triangle sum of angles theorem. There are angles that do not need variables as the less variables the better.

\begin{align*} \angle A &= y \\ \angle B &= x+z \\ \angle C &= \frac{180-x}{2} \\ \end{align*}
Then, using triangle sum of angles theorem, we find that

\begin{align*} \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = x+y+z+\frac{180-x}{2}=180 \\ \end{align*}
Now we just need to find the variables.

\begin{align*} (180-2y)+z = 180& \\ (180-2z)+y+\frac{180-x}{2} = 180& \\ \end{align*}
Notice how all the equations equal 180. We can use this to write

\begin{align*} (180-2y)+z = (180-2z)+y+\frac{180-x}{2}=x+y+z+\frac{180-x}{2} \\ \end{align*}
Simplifying, we get

\begin{align*} (180-2y)+z=(180-2z)+y+\frac{180-x}{2} \\ 360-4y+2z=360-4z+2y+180-x \\ \end{align*}
\begin{align*} 6z=6y+180-x \\ x=6y-6z+180 \\ \end{align*}
\begin{align*} (180-2y)+z=6y-6z+180+y+z+\frac{180-(6y-6+180)}{2} \\ 360-4y+2z=12y-12z+360+2y+2z+180-6y+6z-180 \\ \end{align*}
\begin{align*} 6z=12y& \\ z=2y& \\ \end{align*}
Theres more. We are at a dead end right now because we forgot that the problem states that the triangle is isosceles. With this, we can write the equation

\begin{align*} \frac{180-x}{2}=x+z \\ \end{align*}
Substituting $z$ with $2y$, we get

\begin{align*} \frac{180-x}{2}=x+2y \\ 180-x=2x+4y \\ \end{align*}\begin{align*} 180-(6y-6z+180)=2(6y-6z+180)+4y& \\ 180-6y+12y-180=12y-24y+360+4y& \\ \end{align*}\begin{align*} 6y=-8y+360& \\ \end{align*}
With this, we get

\begin{align*} y=\frac{180}{7} \\ x=\frac{180}{7} \\ z=\frac{360}{7} \\ \end{align*}
And a final answer of $\frac{180}{7}+\frac{360}{7} = \frac{540}{7} = \boxed{547}$.",no more solutions explained,no more solutions explained
7768,"There is a unique positive real number $x$ such that the three numbers $\log_8{2x}$, $\log_4{x}$, and $\log_2{x}$, in that order, form a geometric progression with positive common ratio. The number $x$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$",17,"Since these form a geometric series, $\frac{\log_2{x}}{\log_4{x}}$ is the common ratio. Rewriting this, we get $\frac{\log_x{4}}{\log_x{2}} = \log_2{4} = 2$ by base change formula. Therefore, the common ratio is 2. Now $\frac{\log_4{x}}{\log_8{2x}} = 2 \implies \log_4{x} = 2\log_8{2} + 2\log_8{x} \implies \frac{1}{2}\log_2{x} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{3}\log_2{x}$

$\implies -\frac{1}{6}\log_2{x} = \frac{2}{3} \implies \log_2{x} = -4 \implies x = \frac{1}{16}$. Therefore, $1 + 16 = \boxed{017}$","If we set $x=2^y$, we can obtain three terms of a geometric sequence through logarithm properties. The three terms are\[\frac{y+1}{3}, \frac{y}{2}, y.\]In a three-term geometric sequence, the middle term squared is equal to the product of the other two terms, so we obtain the following:\[\frac{y^2+y}{3} = \frac{y^2}{4},\]which can be solved to reveal $y = -4$. Therefore, $x = 2^{-4} = \frac{1}{16}$, so our answer is $\boxed{017}$",Let $r$ be the common ratio.

\[\frac{\log_4{x}}{\log_8{(2x)}}=\frac{\log_2{x}}{\log_4{x}}\]\[\log_8{(2x)}\log_2{x}=\log_4{x}\log_4{x}\]
Now we can convert all logarithm bases to $2$ using the identity $\log_a{b}=\log_{a^c}{b^c}$:

\[\log_2{\sqrt[3]{2x}}\log_2{x}=\log_2{\sqrt{x}}\log_2{\sqrt{x}}\]
We can solve for $x$ as follows:

\[\frac{1}{3}\log_2{(2x)}\log_2{x}=\frac{1}{4}\log_2{x}\log_2{x}\]\[\frac{1}{3}\log_2{(2x)}=\frac{1}{4}\log_2{x}\]\[\frac{1}{3}\log_2{2}+\frac{1}{3}\log_2{x}=\frac{1}{4}\log_2{x}\]We get $x=\frac{1}{16}$. Verifying that the common ratio is positive, we find the answer of $\boxed{017}$"

Since we need to minimize the value of $n$, we want to minimize $a$, so we have $a = 5$. Then we know $88=53b+7c$, and we can see the only solution is $b=1$, $c=5$.

Then $b$ must be $0$ or $1.$ If $b = 0$, then $c$ is not an integer, and if $b = 1$, then $7c = 35$, so $c = 5$. Thus $N = 515_{11}$, and $N=5\cdot 121 + 1\cdot 11 + 5 = 621$.

The problem requires that $a$ divides this number, and since we know $a$ divides $a(10,000)$, we need that $a$ divides 2020. Each number contributes the sum of the digits of $a$, as well as $2 + 0 + 2 +0 = 4$. Since $2020$ can be prime factorized as $2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 101$, it has $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 12$ factors. So if we sum all the digits of all possible $a$ values, and add $4 \cdot 12 = 48$, we obtain the answer.

Now we list out all factors of $2,020$, or all possible values of $a$. $1,2,4,5,10,20,101,202,404,505,1010,2020$.

7771,Six cards numbered $1$ through $6$ are to be lined up in a row. Find the number of arrangements of these six cards where one of the cards can be removed leaving the remaining five cards in either ascending or descending order.,52,"Realize that any sequence that works (ascending) can be reversed for descending, so we can just take the amount of sequences that satisfy the ascending condition and multiply by two.

If we choose any of the numbers $1$ through $6$, there are five other spots to put them, so we get $6 \cdot 5 = 30$. However, we overcount some cases. Take the example of $132456$. We overcount this case because we can remove the $3$ or the $2$. Therefore, any cases with two adjacent numbers swapped is overcounted, so we subtract $5$ cases (namely, $213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, 123465$,) to get $30-5=25$, but we have to add back one more for the original case, $123456$. Therefore, there are $26$ cases. Multiplying by $2$ gives the desired answer, $\boxed{052}$.","Similar to above, a $1-1$ correspondence between ascending and descending is established by subtracting each number from $7$.

We note that the given condition is equivalent to ""cycling"" $123456$ for a contiguous subset of it. For example,

$12(345)6 \rightarrow 125346, 124536$

It's not hard to see that no overcount is possible, and that the cycle is either $1$ ""right"" or $1$ ""left."" Therefore, we consider how many elements we flip by. If we flip $1$ or $2$ such elements, then there is one way to cycle them. Otherwise, we have $2$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ascending is $1 + 5 + 2(4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 26$, and multiplying by two gives $\boxed{052}.$","we find the number of ascending arrangements and multiply by 2.

We can choose $5$ cards to be the ascending cards, therefore leaving $6$ places to place the remaining card. There are $\binom{6}{5}\cdot 6=36$ to do this. However, since the problem is asking for the number of arrangements, we overcount cases such as $123456$. Notice that the only arrangements that overcount are $123456$ (case 1) or if two adjacent numbers of $123456$ are switched (case 2).

$\text{Case 1: }$ This arrangement is counted $6$ times. Each time it is counted for any of the $5$ numbers selected. Therefore we need to subtract $5$ cases of overcounting.

$\text{Case 2: }$ Each time $2$ adjacent numbers of switched, there is one overcount. For example, if we have $213456$, both $1$ or $2$ could be removed. Since there are $5$ possible switches, we need to subtract $5$ cases of overcounting.

Therefore, we have $36-5-5=26$ total arrangements of ascending numbers. We multiply by two (for descending) to get the answer of $\boxed{052}.$","Like in previous solutions, we will count the number of ascending arrangements and multiply by 2.

First, consider the arrangement 1-2-3-4-5-6. That gives us 1 arrangement which works.

Next, we can switch two adjacent cards. There are 5 ways to pick two adjacent cards, so this gives us 5 arrangements.

Now, we can ""cycle"" 3 adjacent cards. For example, 1-2-3 becomes 2-3-1 which becomes 3-1-2. There are 4 ways to pick a set of 3 adjacent cards, so this gives us 4x2=8 arrangements.

Cycling 4 adjacent cards, we get the new arrangements 2-3-4-1 (which works), 3-4-1-2 (which doesn't work), and 4-1-2-3 (which does work). We get 6 arrangements.

Similarly, when cycling 5 cards, we find 2x2=4 arrangements, and when cycling 6 cards, we find 2x1=2 arrangements.

Adding, we figure out that there are 1+5+8+6+4+2=26 ascending arrangements. Multiplying by 2, we get the answer $\boxed{052}.$","First count the number of permutations of the cards such that if one card is removed, the remaining cards will be in ascending order. There is $1$ such permutation where all the cards appear in order: $123456.$ There are $5$ such permutations where two adjacent cards are interchanged, as in $124356.$ The other such permutations arise from removing one card from $123456$ and placing it in a position at least two away from its starting location. There are $4$ such positions to place each of the cards numbered $1$ and $6,$ and $3$ such positions for each of the cards numbered $2, 3, 4,$ and $5.$ This accounts for $2\cdot4 + 4\cdot3 =20$ permutations. Thus there are $1 + 5 + 20 = 26$ permutations where one card can be removed so that the remaining cards are in ascending order. There is an equal number of permutations that result in the cards' being in descending order. This gives the total $26 + 26 = \boxed{52}$"

The other circle follows similarly for a height (outside the hole) of $\sqrt{r^2-4}$. Now, if we take the cross section of the entire board, essentially making it two-dimensional, we can connect the centers of the two spheres, then form another right triangle with base $7$, as given by the problem.

Since choosing 12 individuals from the total of 23 would give $k$ women and $12-k$ men, the number of committee selections is $\binom{23}{12}$. The answer is $\boxed{081}$","We casework on the amount of men on the committee.

If there are no men in the committee, there are $\dbinom{12}{1}$ ways to pick the women on the committee, for a total of $\dbinom{11}{0} \cdot \dbinom{12}{1}$. Notice that $\dbinom{11}{0}$ is equal to $\dbinom{11}{11}$, so the case where no men are picked can be grouped with the case where all men are picked. When all men are picked, all women must also be picked, for a total of $\dbinom{12}{12}$. Therefore, these cases can be combined to\[\dbinom{11}{0} \cdot \left(\dbinom{12}{1} + \dbinom{12}{12}\right)\]Since $\dbinom{12}{12} = \dbinom{12}{0}$, and $\dbinom{12}{0} + \dbinom{12}{1} = \dbinom{13}{1}$, we can further simplify this to\[\dbinom{11}{0} \cdot \dbinom{13}{1}\]
All other cases proceed similarly. For example, the case with one men or ten men is equal to $\dbinom{11}{1} \cdot \dbinom{13}{2}$. Now, if we factor out a $13$, then all cases except the first two have a factor of $121$, so we can factor this out too to make our computation slightly easier.

Then $OP^2=\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.",103,"We notice that the moves cycle every 6 moves, so we plot out the first 6 moves on the coordinate grid with point $O$ as the origin. We will keep a tally of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate separately. Then, we will combine them and account for the cycling using the formula for an infinite geometric series.

First move: The ant moves right $5$. Second move: We use properties of a $30-60-90$ triangle to get $\frac{5}{4}$ right, $\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{4}$ up. Third move: $\frac{5}{8}$ left, $\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{8}$ up. Fourth move: $\frac{5}{8}$ left. Fifth move: $\frac{5}{32}$ left, $\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{32}$ down. Sixth move: $\frac{5}{64}$ right, $\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{64}$ down.

Total of x-coordinate: $5 + \frac{5}{4} - \frac{5}{8} - \frac{5}{8}  - \frac{5}{32} + \frac{5}{64} = \frac{315}{64}$. Total of y-coordinate: $0 + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{8} + 0 - \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{32} - \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{64} = \frac{105\sqrt{3}}{64}$.

After this cycle of six moves, all moves repeat with a factor of $(\frac{1}{2})^6 = \frac{1}{64}$. Using the formula for a geometric series, multiplying each sequence by $\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{64}} = \frac{64}{63}$ will give us the point $P$.

Now, knowing the initial $x$ and $y,$ we plug this into the geometric series formula ($\frac{a}{1-r}$), and we get $\frac{315}{64} \cdot \frac{64}{63} = 5$, $\frac{105\sqrt{3}}{64} \cdot \frac{64}{63} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

Now, we use coordinates meaning $(5+5/4-5/8, 0+5\sqrt3/4+5\sqrt3/8)$ or $(45/8, 15\sqrt3/8)$. Multiplying these by $8/9$, we get $(5, 5\sqrt3/3)$ $\implies$ $\boxed{103}$ .","Suppose that the bug starts at the origin $(0,0)$ and travels a distance of $a$ units due east on the first day, and that there is a real number $r$ with $0<r < 1$ such that each day after the first, the bug walks $r$ times as far as the previous day. On day $n$, the bug travels along the vector $\pmb v_{n}$ that has magnitude $ar^{n-1}$ and direction $\langle\cos(n\cdot 60^\circ),\sin(n\cdot 60^\circ)\rangle$. Then $P$ is the terminal point of the infinite sum of the vectors $\pmb v_{1}+\pmb v_{2}+\pmb v_3+\cdots$. The $x$-coordinate of this sum is\[a\big(\!\cos0^\circ+r\cos60^\circ + r^{2}\cos120^\circ+r^{3}\cos180^\circ+r^{4}\cos240^\circ\]\[+r^{5}\cos300^\circ+r^{6}\cos360^\circ+\cdots\big).\]Because the angles repeat after 6 terms, this sum is equal to\[aS(1+r^{6}+r^{12}+r^{18}+\cdots)=\frac{aS}{1-r^{6}},\]where\[S=\cos0^\circ+r\cos60^\circ + r^{2}\cos120^\circ+r^{3}\cos180^\circ+r^{4}\cos240^\circ+ r^{5}\cos300^\circ.\]Similarly, the $y$-coordinate of $P$ will be ${\frac{aT}{1-r^{6}}}$, where\[T=\sin0^\circ+r\sin60^\circ + r^{2}\sin120^\circ+r^{3}\sin180^\circ+r^{4}\sin240^\circ+ r^{5}\sin300^\circ.\]In this case $r=\frac12$ and $a = 5$, so\[S=1+\frac14-\frac18-\frac18-\frac1{32}+\frac1{64}=\frac{63}{64},\]\[T=0+\frac{\sqrt3}4+\frac{\sqrt3}8+0-\frac{\sqrt3}{32}-\frac{\sqrt3}{64}=\frac{21\sqrt3}{64},\]and the coordinates of $P$ are\[\left(\frac{5S}{1-\frac1{64}}, \frac{5T}{1-\frac1{64}}\right)=\left(5,\frac{5\sqrt3}{3}\right).\]Thus the square of the distance from the origin to $P$ is $25+\frac{25}3=\frac{100}3$.

It travels $5-\frac{5}{8}+\frac{5}{64}-\cdots=\frac{40}{9}$ units east. Thus, it goes northeast $\frac{\frac{40}{9}}{2}=\frac{20}{9}$ units northeast and $\frac{10}{9}$ units northwest. Now, the bug travels a total of $\frac{40}{9}+\frac{10}{9}-\frac{5}{9}=\frac{45}{9}=5$ units east and a total of $\frac{10\sqrt{3}}{9}+\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{9}=\frac{15\sqrt{3}}{9}=\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}$ units north because of the 30-60-90 right triangles formed.

Find $m.$",77,"First, prime factorize $20^9$ as $2^{18} \cdot 5^9$. Denote $a_1$ as $2^{b_1} \cdot 5^{c_1}$, $a_2$ as $2^{b_2} \cdot 5^{c_2}$, and $a_3$ as $2^{b_3} \cdot 5^{c_3}$.

In order for $a_1$ to divide $a_2$, and for $a_2$ to divide $a_3$, $b_1\le b_2\le b_3$, and $c_1\le c_2\le c_3$. We will consider each case separately. Note that the total amount of possibilities is $190^3$, as there are $(18+1)(9+1)=190$ choices for each factor.

We notice that if we add $1$ to $b_2$ and $2$ to $b_3$, then we can reach the stronger inequality $0\le b_1<b_2+1<b_3+2\le 20$. Therefore, if we pick $3$ integers from $0$ to $20$, they will correspond to a unique solution, forming a 1-1 correspondence between the numbers $b_1$, $b_2+1$, and $b_3+2$. This is also equivalent to applying stars and bars on distributing the powers of 2 and 5 through differences. The amount of solutions to this inequality is $\dbinom{21}{3}$.

The case for $c_1$,$c_2$, and $c_3$ proceeds similarly for a result of $\dbinom{12}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing three such factors is\[\frac{\dbinom{21}{3} \cdot \dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\]Simplification gives $\frac{77}{1805}$, and therefore the answer is $\boxed{077}$","Same as before, say the factors have powers of $b$ and $c$. $b_1, b_2, b_3$ can either be all distinct, all equal, or two of the three are equal. As well, we must have $b_1 \leq b_2 \leq b_3$. If they are all distinct, the number of cases is simply ${19 \choose 3}$. If they are all equal, there are only $19$ cases for the general value. If we have a pair equal, then we have $2 \cdot {19\choose 2}$. We need to multiply by $2$ because if we have two values $b_i < b_j$, we can have either $(b_i, b_i, b_j)$ or $(b_i, b_j, b_j)$.

\[{19 \choose 3} + 2 \cdot {19 \choose 2} + 19 = 1330\]
Likewise for $c$, we get

\[{10 \choose 3} + 2 \cdot {10 \choose 2} + 10 = 220\]
The final probability is simply $\frac{1330 \cdot 220}{190^3}$.

The maximum power of $2$ is $18$, and the maximum power of $5$ is $9$. Using the Hockey Stick identity, we figure out that there are $\dbinom{12}{3}$ ways to choose $d$, $f$ and $g$, and $\dbinom{21}{3}$ ways to choose $a$, $b$, and $c$. Therefore, the probability of choosing $3$ factors which satisfy the conditions is\[\frac{\dbinom{21}{3} \cdot \dbinom{12}{3}}{190^3}.\]This simplifies to $\frac{77}{1805}$, therefore $m =$ $\boxed{077}$.","Note that the prime factorization of $20^9$ is $2^{18}\cdot5^{9}.$ The problem reduces to selecting independently the powers of $2$ and the powers of $5$ in the numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$. This is equivalent to selecting $3$ exponents for the powers of $2$ and $3$ exponents for the powers of $5$ and determining in each case the probability that the 3 exponents are chosen in nondecreasing order. Given a positive integer $k$, the probability that three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ are chosen such that $0\le a \le b\le c \le k$ is the probability that $a$, $b+1$, and $c+2$ are chosen such that $0 \le a < b+1 < c+2 \le k+2$.

Noting $k = 26$ is the minimal that satisfies this, we get $(n,m) = (121,286)$.

If a prime $p$ divides $n$, then $p$ divides $n^n$, so it also divides $m^m$, and thus $p$ divides $m$. Therefore any prime $p$ dividing $n$ also divides both $m$ and $k = m + n$. Because $k$ is relatively prime to $210=2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7$, the primes $2$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ cannot divide $n$. Furthermore, because $m$ is divisible by every prime factor of $n$, but $m$ is not a multiple of $n$, the integer $n$ must be divisible by the square of some prime, and that prime must be at least $11$. Thus $n$ must be at least $11^2 = 121$.

If $n=11^2$, then $m$ must be a multiple of $11$ but not a multiple of $121$, and $m^m$ must be divisible by $n^n = 121^{121} = 11^{242}$. Therefore $m$ must be a multiple of $11$ that is greater than $242$. Let $m = 11m_0$, with $m_0 > 22$. Then $k = m + n = 11(m_0 + 11)$. The least $m_0 > 22$ for which $m_0 + 11$ is not divisible by any of the primes $2$, $3$, $5$, or $7$ is $m_0 = 26$, giving the prime $m_0 + 11 = 37$. Hence the least possible $k$ when $n = 121$ is $k = 11 \cdot 37 = 407$.

It remains to consider other possible values for $n$. If $n = 13^2 = 169$, then $m$ must be divisible by $13$ but not $169$, and $m^m$ must be a multiple of $n^n = 169^{169} = 13^{338}$, so $m > 338$. Then $k = m + n > 169 + 338 = 507$. All other possible values for $n$ have $n \ge 242$, and in this case $m > n \ge 242$, so $k \ge 2 \cdot 242 = 484$.

7778,Let $n$ be the least positive integer for which $149^n-2^n$ is divisible by $3^3\cdot5^5\cdot7^7.$ Find the number of positive integer divisors of $n.$,270,"As usual, denote $v_p(n)$ the highest power of prime $p$ that divides $n$. Lifting the Exponent shows that\[3=v_3(149^n-2^n) = v_3(n) + v_3(147) = v_3(n)+1\]so thus, $3^2$ divides $n$. It also shows that\[7=v_7(149^n-2^n) = v_7(n) + v_7(147) = v_7(n)+2\]so thus, $7^5$ divides $n$.


Now, setting $n = 4c$ (necessitated by $149^n \equiv 2^n \pmod 5$ in order to set up LTE), we see\[v_5(149^{4c}-2^{4c}) = v_5(149^{4c}-16^{c})\]and since $149^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$ and $16^1 \equiv 16 \pmod{25}$ then $v_5(149^{4c}-2^{4c})=v_5(149^4-16)+v_5(c)=1+v_5(c)$ meaning that we have that by LTE, $5^4 | c$ and $4 \cdot 5^4$ divides $n$.

Since $3^2$, $7^5$ and $4\cdot 5^4$ all divide $n$, the smallest value of $n$ working is their LCM, also $3^2 \cdot 7^5 \cdot 4 \cdot 5^4 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^5$. Thus the number of divisors is $(2+1)(2+1)(4+1)(5+1) = \boxed{270}$","Note that for all $n$, $149^n - 2^n$ is divisible by $149-2 = 147$ by difference of $n$th powers. That is $3\cdot7^2$, so now we can clearly see that the smallest $n$ to make the expression divisible by $3^3$ is just $3^2$. Similarly, we can reason that the smallest $n$ to make the expression divisible by $7^7$ is just $7^5$.

Finally, for $5^5$, take $\pmod {5}$ and $\pmod {25}$ of each quantity (They happen to both be $-1$ and $2$ respectively, so you only need to compute once). One knows from Fermat's theorem that the maximum possible minimum $n$ for divisibility by $5$ is $4$, and other values are factors of $4$. Testing all of them(just $1$,$2$,$4$ using mods-not too bad), $4$ is indeed the smallest value to make the expression divisible by $5$, and this clearly is NOT divisible by $25$. Therefore, the smallest $n$ to make this expression divisible by $5^5$ is $2^2 \cdot 5^4$.

Calculating the LCM of all these, one gets $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^5$. Using the factor counting formula, the answer is $3\cdot3\cdot5\cdot6$ = $\boxed{270}$","As usual, denote $v_p(n)$ the highest power of prime $p$ that divides $n$.

In addition, $149^9 - 2^9$ is divisible by $3^3$ because $149^9 - 2^9 = (149^3 - 2^3)(149^6 + 149^3\cdot2^3 + 2^6)$, and the rightmost factor equates to $1 + 1 + 1 \pmod{3} \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. In fact, $n = 9 = 3^2$ is the least possible choice to ensure divisibility by $3^3$ because if $n = a \cdot 3^b$, with $3 \nmid a$ and $b < 2$, we write\[149^{a \cdot 3^b} - 2^{a \cdot 3^b} =  (149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b})(149^{3^b(a - 1)} + 149^{3^b(a - 2)}\cdot2^{3^b}+\cdots2^{3^b(a - 1)}).\]Then, the rightmost factor is equivalent to $\pm a \pmod{3} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, and $v_3(149^{3^b} - 2^{3^b}) = b + 1 < 3$.

For divisibility by $7^7$, we'll induct, claiming that $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$ for whole numbers $k$. The base case is clear. Then,\[v_7(149^{7^{k+1}} - 2^{7^{k+1}}) = v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) + v_7(149^{6\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\cdot149^{5\cdot7^k} + \cdots + 2^{5\cdot7^k}\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\cdot7^k}).\]By the induction hypothesis, $v_7(149^{7^k} - 2^{7^k}) = k + 2$. Then, notice that\[S(k) = 149^{6\cdot7^k} + 2^{7^k}\cdot149^{5\cdot7^k} + \cdots + 2^{5\cdot7^k}\cdot149^{7^k} + 2^{6\cdot7^k} \equiv 7 \cdot 2^{6\cdot7^k}\pmod{7} \equiv 7 \cdot 2^{6\cdot7^k}\pmod{49}.\]This tells us that $S(k)$ is divisible by $7$, but not $49$ so that $v_7\left(S(k)\right) = 1$, completing our induction. We can verify that $7^5$ is the least choice of $n$ to ensure divisibility by $7^7$ by arguing similarly to the $3^3$ case.

Finally, for $5^5$, we take the powers of $149$ and $2$ in mod $5$ and mod $25$. Writing out these mods, we have that $149^n \equiv 2^n \pmod{5}$ if and only if $4 | n$, in which $149^n \equiv 2^n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. So here we claim that $v_5(149^{4\cdot5^k} - 2^{4\cdot5^k}) = k + 1$ and perform yet another induction. The base case is true: $5 | 149^4 - 2^4$, but $149^4 - 2^4 \equiv 1 - 16 \pmod{25}$. Now then, assuming the induction statement to hold for some $k$,\[v_5(149^{4\cdot5^{k+1}} - 2^{4\cdot5^{k+1}}) = (k+1) + v_5(149^{4\cdot4\cdot5^k}+2^{4\cdot5^k}\cdot149^{3\cdot4\cdot5^k}+\cdots+2^{3\cdot4\cdot5^k}\cdot149^{4\cdot5^k}+2^{4\cdot4\cdot5^k}).\]Note that $S'(k) =  149^{4\cdot4\cdot5^k}+2^{4\cdot5^k}\cdot149^{3\cdot4\cdot5^k}+\cdots+2^{3\cdot4\cdot5^k}\cdot149^{4\cdot5^k}+2^{4\cdot4\cdot5^k}$ equates to $S''(k) = 1 + 2^{4\cdot5^k} + \cdots + 2^{16\cdot5^k}$ in both mod $5$ and mod $25$. We notice that $S''(k) \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$. Writing out the powers of $2$ mod $25$, we have $S''(0) \equiv 5 \pmod{25}$. Also $2^n \equiv 1 \pmod{25}$ when $n$ is a multiple of $20$. Hence for $k > 0$, $S''(k) \equiv 5 \mod{25}$. Thus, $v_5\left(S'(k)\right) = 1$, completing our induction. Applying the same argument from the previous two cases, $4\cdot5^4$ is the least choice to ensure divisibility by $5^5$.

Our answer is the number of divisors of $\text{lcm}(3^2, 7^5, 2^2\cdot5^4) = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^5$. It is $(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(4 + 1)(5 + 1) = \boxed{270}$","Analyze each prime power separately. Start with the case of $3^3$. By the Binomial Theorem,\begin{align*} 		149^n - 2^n &= (147+2)^n - 2^n \\ 		&= \binom n1 \cdot 147 \cdot 2^{n-1} 		+ \binom n2 \cdot 147^2 \cdot 2^{n-2}\\ 		&\qquad+ \binom n3 \cdot 147^3 \cdot 2^{n-3} 		+ \cdots. 	\end{align*}Because $147$ is divisible by $3$, all terms after the first two are divisible by $3^3$, and the exponent of $3$ in the first term is less than that in the second term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $3^3 \mid 147n$, that is, $3^2 \mid n$. For the $7^7$ case, consider the same expansion as in the previous case. Because $147$ is divisible by $49 = 7^2$, all terms after the first three are divisible by $7^7$, and the exponent of $7$ in the first term is less than that in the second and third term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $7^7 \mid 147n$, that is, $7^5 \mid n$. For the $5^5$ case, working modulo $5$ gives $149^n - 2^n \equiv 4^n - 2^n = 2^n(2^n-1) \pmod 5$, so it must be that $4 \mid n$. Let $n = 4m$, and let $c = 149^4 - 2^4 = (149^2-2^2)(149^2+2^2) = 147 \cdot 151 \cdot 22205$. Note that $\frac c5$ is an integer not divisible by $5$. Expand by the Binomial Theorem again to get\begin{align*} 		(149^4)^m - (2^4)^m &= (c+16)^m - (16)^m \\ 		&= \binom m1 \cdot c \cdot 16^{m-1} 		+ \binom m2 \cdot c^2 \cdot 16^{m-2} \\ 		&\qquad+ \binom m3 \cdot c^3 \cdot 16^{m-3} 		+ \binom m4 \cdot c^4 \cdot 16^{m-4} 		+ \cdots. 	\end{align*}All terms after the first four are divisible by $5^5$, and the exponent of $5$ in the first term is less than that in the second, third, or fourth term. Hence it is necessary and sufficient that $5^5 \mid cm$. Thus $5^4 \mid m$, and it follows that $4 \cdot 5^4 \mid n$. Therefore the least $n$ is $3^2 \cdot (2^2 \cdot 5^4) \cdot 7^5$. The requested number of divisors is $(1+2)(1+2)(1+4)(1+5) = 270$.",no more solutions explained

Given that $AB=4,BC=5,$ and $CA=6,$ the area of $\triangle AEF$ can be written as $\tfrac{m\sqrt{n}}p,$ where $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $n$ is a positive integer not divisible by the square of any prime.

Now, note that $AD$ is the altitude of $\triangle AFE$, as the altitude of $AGH$. We need to compare these altitudes in order to compare their areas. Note that Stewart's theorem implies that $AD/2 = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{2}$, the altitude of $\triangle AFE$. Similarly, the altitude of $\triangle AGH$ is the altitude of $\triangle ABC$, or $\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}$. However, it's not too hard to see that $GB = HC = 1$, and therefore $[AGH] = [ABC]$. From here, we get that the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{14} \implies \boxed{036}$","Let $M_A$, $M_B$, $M_C$ be the midpoints of arcs $BC$, $CA$, $AB$. By Fact 5, we know that $M_AB = M_AC = M_AI$, and so by Ptolmey's theorem, we deduce that\[AB\cdot M_AC + AC\cdot M_AB = BC\cdot M_AA \implies M_AA = 2M_AI.\]In particular, we have $AI = IM_A$.[asy] defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); size(200); pair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, P, MA, MB, MC; B = (0,0); C = (5,0); A = IP(Circle(B, 4), Circle(C, 6), 0); I = incenter(A, B, C); D = extension(A, I, B, C); P = midpoint(A--D); E = extension(P, rotate(90, P)*A, B, I); F = extension(P, rotate(90, P)*A, C, I); MA = IP(Line(A, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); MB = IP(Line(B, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); MC = IP(Line(C, I, 20), circumcircle(A, B, C), 1); draw(A--B--C--cycle, orange); draw(circumcircle(A, B, C), red); draw(A--E--F--cycle, lightblue); draw(E--D--F, lightblue); draw(A--MA^^B--MB^^C--MC, heavygreen); draw(MA--MB--MC--cycle, magenta); dot(""$A$"", A, dir(120)); dot(""$B$"", B, dir(220)); dot(""$C$"", C, dir(320)); dot(""$D$"", D, dir(230)); dot(""$E$"", E, dir(330)); dot(""$F$"", F, dir(250)); dot(""$I$"", I, dir(80)); dot(""$M_A$"", MA, dir(270)); dot(""$M_B$"", MB, dir(60)); dot(""$M_C$"", MC, dir(150)); [/asy]Now the key claim is that:

Claim: $\triangle DEF$ and $\triangle M_AM_BM_C$ are homothetic at $I$ with ratio $2$.

Proof. First, we show that $D$ is the midpoint of $M_AI$. Indeed, we have\[\frac{ID}{DM_A} = \frac{BI}{BM_A}\cdot \frac{\sin\angle IBC}{\sin \angle CBM_A} = \frac{BI}{AI}\cdot\frac{\sin \angle B/2}{\sin \angle A/2} = 1\]by Ratio lemma and Law of Sines.

Now observe that:

$\overline{M_BM_C}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AI}$,
$\overline{EF}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AD}$, and
$ID = AI/2$.
Combining these facts gives that $\overline{EF}$ is a midline in $\triangle IM_BM_C$, which proves the claim. $\blacksquare$

To finish, we compute $[M_AM_BM_C]$, noting that $[AEF] = [DEF] = \tfrac{1}{4}[M_AM_BM_C]$.

By Heron's, we can calculate the circumradius $R = 8/\sqrt{7}$, and by Law of Cosines, we get\begin{align*}\cos A &= \frac{9}{16}\implies \cos A/2 = \frac{5}{\sqrt{32}} \\ \cos B &= \frac{1}{8} \implies \cos B/2 = \frac{3}{4} \\ \cos C &= \frac{3}{4} \implies \cos C/2 = \sqrt{\frac{7}{8}}.\end{align*}Then using $[XYZ] = 2R^2\sin X\sin Y\sin Z$, we can compute\[[M_AM_BM_C] = 2\cdot \frac{64}{7}\cdot \frac{5}{\sqrt{32}}\cdot \frac{3}{4}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{30\sqrt{7}}{7}.\]Thus $[AEF] = 15\sqrt{7}/14$, which gives a final answer of $\boxed{036}$.","Let $\overline{BC}$ lie on the x-axis and $B$ be the origin. $C$ is $(5,0)$. Use Heron's formula to compute the area of triangle $ABC$. We have $s=\frac{15}{2}$. and $[ABC]=\sqrt{\frac{15 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 3}{2^4}}=\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{4}$. We now find the altitude, which is $\frac{\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{2}}{5}=\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}$, which is the y-coordinate of $A$. We now find the x-coordinate of $A$, which satisfies $x^2 + (\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2})^{2}=16$, which gives $x=\frac{1}{2}$ since the triangle is acute. Now using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{BD}{CD}$ and $BD+CD=5$ to get $BD=2$. The coordinates of D are $(2,0)$. Since we want the area of triangle $AEF$, we will find equations for perpendicular bisector of AD, and the other two angle bisectors. The perpendicular bisector is not too challenging: the midpoint of AD is $(\frac{5}{4}, \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4})$ and the slope of AD is $-\sqrt{7}$. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}$. The equation is(in point slope form) $y-\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}(x-\frac{5}{4})$. The slope of AB, or in trig words, the tangent of $\angle ABC$ is $3\sqrt{7}$. Finding $\sin{\angle ABC}=\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}}{4}=\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{8}$ and $\cos{\angle ABC}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{4}=\frac{1}{8}$. Plugging this in to half angle tangent, it gives $\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{8}}{1+\frac{1}{8}}=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}$ as the slope of the angle bisector, since it passes through $B$, the equation is $y=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}x$. Similarly, the equation for the angle bisector of $C$ will be $y=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}(x-5)$. For $E$ use the B-angle bisector and the perpendicular bisector of AD equations to intersect at $(3,\sqrt{7})$. For $F$ use the C-angle bisector and the perpendicular bisector of AD equations to intersect at $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{9}{2\sqrt{7}})$. The area of AEF is equal to $\frac{EF \cdot \frac{AD}{2}}{2}$ since AD is the altitude of that triangle with EF as the base, with $\frac{AD}{2}$ being the height. $EF=\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}}$ and $AD=3\sqrt{2}$, so $[AEF]=\frac{15}{2\sqrt{7}}=\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{14}$ which gives $\boxed{036}$. NEVER overlook coordinate bash in","Let $B=(0,0)$ and $BC$ be the line $y=0$. We compute that $\cos{\angle{ABC}}=\frac{1}{8}$, so $\tan{\angle{ABC}}=3\sqrt{7}$. Thus, $A$ lies on the line $y=3x\sqrt{7}$. The length of $AB$ at a point $x$ is $8x$, so $x=\frac{1}{2}$.

We now have the coordinates $A=\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}\right)$, $B=(0,0)$ and $C=(5,0)$. We also have $D=(2,0)$ by the angle-bisector theorem and $M=\left(\frac{5}{4},\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4}\right)$ by taking the midpoint. We have that because $\cos{\angle{ABC}}=\frac{1}{8}$, $\cos{\frac{\angle{ABC}}{2}}=\frac{3}{4}$ by half angle formula.

We also compute $\cos{\angle{ACB}}=\frac{3}{4}$, so $\cos{\frac{\angle{ACB}}{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{14}}{4}$.

Now, $AD$ has slope $-\frac{\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{2}}{2-\frac{1}{2}}=-\sqrt{7}$, so it's perpendicular bisector has slope $\frac{\sqrt{7}}{7}$ and goes through $\left(\frac{5}{4},\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4}\right)$.

We find that this line has equation $y=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{7}x+\frac{4\sqrt{7}}{7}$.

As $\cos{\angle{CBI}}=\frac{3}{4}$, we have that line $BI$ has form $y=\frac{\sqrt{7}}{3}x$. Solving for the intersection point of these two lines, we get $x=3$ and thus $E=\left(3, \sqrt{7}\right)$

We also have that because $\cos{\angle{ICB}}=\frac{\sqrt{14}}{4}$, $CI$ has form $y=-\frac{x\sqrt{7}}{7}+\frac{5\sqrt{7}}{7}$.

Intersecting the line $CI$ and the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ yields $-\frac{x\sqrt{7}}{7}+\frac{5\sqrt{7}}{7}=\frac{x\sqrt{7}}{7}+\frac{4\sqrt{7}}{7}$.

Solving this, we get $x=\frac{1}{2}$ and so $F=\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{9\sqrt{7}}{14}\right)$.

We now compute $EF=\sqrt{\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{5\sqrt{7}}{14}\right)^2}=\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{7}$. We also have $MA=\sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2+\left(\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4}\right)^2}=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

As ${MA}\perp{EF}$, we have $[\triangle{AEF}]=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\times\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{7}\right)=\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{14}$","As usual, we will use homogenized barycentric coordinates.

We have that $AD$ will have form $3z=2y$. Similarly, $CF$ has form $5y=6x$ and $BE$ has form $5z=4x$. Since $A=(1,0,0)$ and $D=\left(0,\frac{3}{5},\frac{2}{5}\right)$, we also have $M=\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{10},\frac{1}{5}\right)$. It remains to determine the equation of the line formed by the perpendicular bisector of $AD$.

This can be found using EFFT. Let a point $T$ on $EF$ have coordinates $(x, y, z)$. We then have that the displacement vector $\overrightarrow{AD}=\left(-1, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{2}{5}\right)$ and that the displacement vector $\overrightarrow{TM}$ has form $\left(x-\frac{1}{2},y-\frac{3}{10},z-\frac{1}{5}\right)$. Now, by EFFT, we have $5^2\left(\frac{3}{5}\times\left(z-\frac{1}{5}\right)+\frac{2}{5}\times\left(y-\frac{3}{10}\right)\right)+6^2\left(-1\times\left(z-\frac{1}{5}\right)+\frac{2}{5}\times\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)+4^2\left(-1\times\left(y-\frac{3}{10}\right)+\frac{3}{5}\times\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)=0$. This equates to $8x-2y-7z=2$.

Now, intersecting this with $BE$, we have $5z=4x$, $8x-2y-7z=2$, and $x+y+z=1$. This yields $x=\frac{2}{3}$, $y=-\frac{1}{5}$, and $z=\frac{8}{15}$, or $E=\left(\frac{2}{3},-\frac{1}{5},\frac{8}{15}\right)$.

Similarly, intersecting this with $CF$, we have $5y=6x$, $8x-2y-7z=2$, and $x+y+z=1$. Solving this, we obtain $x=\frac{3}{7}$, $y=\frac{18}{35}$, and $z=\frac{2}{35}$, or $F=\left(\frac{3}{7},\frac{18}{35},\frac{2}{35}\right)$.

We finish by invoking the Barycentric Distance Formula twice; our first displacement vector being $\overrightarrow{FE}=\left(\frac{5}{21},-\frac{5}{7},\frac{10}{21}\right)$. We then have $FE^2=-25\left(-\frac{5}{7}\cdot\frac{10}{21}\right)-36\left(\frac{5}{21}\cdot\frac{10}{21}\right)-16\left(\frac{5}{21}\cdot-\frac{5}{7}\right)=\frac{50}{7}$, thus $FE=\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{7}$.

Our second displacement vector is $\overrightarrow{AM}=\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{10},\frac{1}{5}\right)$. As a result, $AM^2=-25\left(\frac{3}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{5}\right)-36\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{5}\right)-16\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{10}\right)=\frac{9}{2}$, so $AM=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

As ${AM}\perp{EF}$, the desired area is $\frac{\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{7}\times\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}={\frac{15\sqrt{7}}{14}}\implies{m+n+p=\boxed{036}}$"

We first see that if $P(3) = P(4)$ it's easy to obtain by Vieta's that $(a+b)^2 = 49$. Now, take $P(3) \neq P(4)$ and WLOG $P(3) = P(a), P(4) = P(b)$. Now, consider the parabola formed by the graph of $P$. It has vertex $\frac{3+a}{2}$. Now, say that $P(x) = x^2 - (3+a)x + c$. We note $P(3)P(4) = c = P(3)\left(4 - 4a + \frac{8a - 1}{2}\right) \implies a = \frac{7P(3) + 1}{8}$. Now, we note $P(4) = \frac{7}{2}$ by plugging in again. Now, it's easy to find that $a = -2.5, b = -3.5$, yielding a value of $36$. Finally, we add $49 + 36 = \boxed{085}$","Let the roots of $P(x)$ be $m$ and $n$, then we can write\[P(x)=x^2-(m+n)x+mn\]The fact that $P(P(x))=0$ has solutions $x=3,4,a,b$ implies that some combination of $2$ of these are the solution to $P(x)=m$, and the other $2$ are the solution to $P(x)=n$. It's fairly easy to see there are only $2$ possible such groupings: $P(3)=P(4)=m$ and $P(a)=P(b)=n$, or $P(3)=P(a)=m$ and $P(4)=P(b)=n$ (Note that $a,b$ are interchangeable, and so are $m$ and $n$). We now casework: If $P(3)=P(4)=m$, then\[9-3(m+n)+mn=16-4(m+n)+mn=m \implies m+n=7\]\[a^2-a(m+n)+mn=b^2-b(m+n)+mn=n \implies a+b=m+n=7\]so this gives $(a+b)^2=7^2=49$. Next, if $P(3)=P(a)=m$, then\[9-3(m+n)+mn=a^2-a(m+n)+mn=m \implies a+3=m+n\]\[16-4(m+n)+mn=b^2-b(m+n)+mn=n \implies b+4=m+n\]Subtracting the first part of the first equation from the first part of the second equation gives\[7-(m+n)=n-m \implies 2n=7 \implies n=\frac{7}{2} \implies m=-3\]Hence, $a+b=2(m+n)-7=2\cdot \frac{1}{2}-7=-6$, and so $(a+b)^2=(-6)^2=36$. Therefore, the solution is $49+36=\boxed{085}$","Write $P(x) = x^2+wx+z$. Split the problem into two cases: $P(3)\ne P(4)$ and $P(3) = P(4)$.

Case 1: We have $P(3) \ne P(4)$. We must have\[w=-P(3)-P(4) = -(9+3w+z)-(16+4w+z) = -25-7w-2z.\]Rearrange and divide through by $8$ to obtain\[w = \frac{-25-2z}{8}.\]Now, note that\[z = P(3)P(4) = (9+3w+z)(16+4w+z) = \left(9 + 3\cdot \frac{-25-2z}{8} + z\right)\left(16 + 4 \cdot \frac{-25-2z}{8} + z\right) =\]\[\left(-\frac{3}{8} + \frac{z}{4}\right)\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) = -\frac{21}{16} + \frac{7z}{8}.\]Now, rearrange to get\[\frac{z}{8} = -\frac{21}{16}\]and thus\[z = -\frac{21}{2}.\]Substituting this into our equation for $w$ yields $w = -\frac{1}{2}$. Then, it is clear that $P$ does not have a double root at $P(3)$, so we must have $P(a) = P(3)$ and $P(b) = P(4)$ or vice versa. This gives $3+a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $4+b = \frac{1}{2}$ or vice versa, implying that $a+b = 1-3-4 = -6$ and $(a+b)^2 = 36$.

Case 2: We have $P(3) = P(4)$. Then, we must have $w = -7$. It is clear that $P(a) = P(b)$ (we would otherwise get $P(a)=P(3)=P(4)$ implying $a \in \{3,4\}$ or vice versa), so $a+b=-w=7$ and $(a+b)^2 = 49$.

Thus, our final answer is $49+36=\boxed{085}$","Let $P(x) = (x-c)^2 - d$ for some $c$, $d$.

Then, we can write $P(P(x)) = ((x-c)^2 - d - c)^2 - d$. Setting the expression equal to $0$ and solving for $x$ gives:

$x = \pm \sqrt{ \pm \sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$

Therefore, we have that $x$ takes on the four values $\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$, $-\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$, $\sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$, and $-\sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$. Two of these values are $3$ and $4$, and the other two are $a$ and $b$.

We can split these four values into two ""groups"" based on the radicand in the expression - for example, the first group consists of the first two values listed above, and the second group consists of the other two values.

$\textbf{Case 1}$: Both the 3 and 4 values are from the same group.

In this case, the $a$ and $b$ values are both from the other group. The sum of this is just $2c$ because the radical cancels out. Because of this, we can see that $c$ is just the average of $3$ and $4$, so we have $2c = 3 + 4 = 7$, so $(a+b)^2 = 7^2 = 49$.

$\textbf{Case 2}$: The 3 and 4 values come from different groups.

It is easy to see that all possibilities in this case are basically symmetric and yield the same value for $(a+b)^2$. Without loss of generality, assume that $\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 4$ and $\sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 3$. Note that we can't switch the values of these two expressions since the first one is guaranteed to be larger.

We can write $\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c = 1 + \sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} + c$.

Moving most terms to the left side and simplifying gives $\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} = 1$.

We can square both sides and simplify:

$\sqrt{d} + d + c - \sqrt{d} + d + c - 2\sqrt{(d + c + \sqrt{d})(d + c - \sqrt{d})} = 1$

$2d + 2c - 2\sqrt{(d + c + \sqrt{d})(d + c - \sqrt{d})} = 1$

$\sqrt{(d + c + \sqrt{d})(d + c - \sqrt{d})} = (d+c) - \frac{1}{2}$

$\sqrt{(d+c)^2 - (\sqrt{d})^2} = (d+c) - \frac{1}{2}$

$\sqrt{d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d} = (d+c) - \frac{1}{2}$

Squaring both sides again gives the following:

$d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d = d^2 + 2dc + c^2 - d - c + \frac{1}{4}$

Nearly all terms cancel out, yielding $c = \frac{1}{4}$.

By substituting this back in, we obtain $\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \frac{15}{4}$ and $\sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} = \frac{11}{4}$.

The sum of $a$ and $b$ is equal to $-\sqrt{\sqrt{d} + d + c} - \sqrt{-\sqrt{d} + d + c} + 2c = -\frac{15}{4} - \frac{11}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = -6$, so $(a+b)^2 = 36$.

Adding up both values gives $49 + 36 = \boxed{085}$","Note that because $P\big(P(3)\big)=P\big(P(4)\big)= 0$, $P(3)$ and $P(4)$ are roots of $P(x)$. There are two cases. CASE 1: $P(3) = P(4)$. Then $P(x)$ is symmetric about $x=\tfrac72$; that is to say, $P(r) = P(7-r)$ for all $r$. Thus the remaining two roots must sum to $7$. Indeed, the polynomials $P(x) = \left(x-\frac72\right)^2 + \frac{11}4 \pm i\sqrt3$ satisfy the conditions. CASE 2: $P(3)\neq P(4)$. Then $P(3)$ and $P(4)$ are the two distinct roots of $P(x)$, so\[P(x) = \big(x-P(3)\big)\big(x-P(4)\big)\]for all $x$. Note that any solution to $P\big(P(x)\big) = 0$ must satisfy either $P(x) = P(3)$ or $P(x) = P(4)$. Because $P(x)$ is quadratic, the polynomials $P(x) - P(3)$ and $P(x) - P(4)$ each have the same sum of roots as the polynomial $P(x)$, which is $P(3) + P(4)$. Thus the answer in this case is $2\big(P(3) + P(4)\big)-7$, and so it suffices to compute the value of $P(3)+P(4)$.

Let $P(3)=u$ and $P(4) = v$. Substituting $x=3$ and $x=4$ into the above quadratic polynomial yields the system of equations\begin{align*} u &= (3-u)(3-v) = 9 - 3u - 3v + uv\\ v &= (4-u)(4-v) = 16 - 4u - 4v + uv. \end{align*}Subtracting the first equation from the second gives $v - u = 7 - u - v$, yielding $v = \frac72.$ Substituting this value into the second equation gives\[\dfrac72 = \left(4 - u\right)\left(4 - \dfrac72\right),\]yielding $u = -3.$ The sum of the two solutions is $2\left(\tfrac72-3\right)-7 = -6$. In this case, $P(x)= (x+3)\left(x-\frac72\right)$.

The requested sum of squares is $7^2+(-6)^2 = \boxed{085}$"

Note that $3HX = HY$ is not insignificant; from here, we set $XH = HE = \frac{1}{2} EY = HL = 2$ by PoP and trivial construction. Now, $D$ is the reflection of $A$ over $H$. Note $AO \perp XY$, and therefore by Pythagorean theorem we have $AE = XD = \sqrt{5}$. Consider $HD = 3$. We have that $\triangle HXD \cong HLK$, and therefore we are ready to PoP with respect to $(BHC)$. Setting $BL = x, LC = y$, we obtain $xy = 10$ by PoP on $(ABC)$, and furthermore, we have $KH^2 = 9 = (KL - x)(KL + y) = (\sqrt{5} - x)(\sqrt{5} + y)$. Now, we get $4 = \sqrt{5}(y - x) - xy$, and from $xy = 10$ we take\[\frac{14}{\sqrt{5}} = y - x.\]However, squaring and manipulating with $xy = 10$ yields that $(x + y)^2 = \frac{396}{5}$ and from here, since $AL = 5$ we get the area to be $3\sqrt{55} \implies \boxed{058}$","We first observe that $H'$, the image of the reflection of $H$ over line $BC$, lies on circle $O$. This is because $\angle HBC = 90 - \angle C = \angle H'AC = \angle H'BC$. This is a well known lemma. The result of this observation is that circle $O'$, the circumcircle of $\triangle BHC$ is the image of circle $O$ over line $BC$, which in turn implies that $\overline{AH} = \overline{OO'}$ and thus $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram. That $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram implies that $AO$ is perpendicular to $\overline{XY}$, and thus divides segment $\overline{XY}$ in two equal pieces, $\overline{XD}$ and $\overline{DY}$, of length $4$.


Using Power of a Point,\[\overline{AH} \cdot \overline{HH'} = \overline{XH} \cdot \overline{HY} \Longrightarrow 3 \cdot \overline{HH'} = 2 \cdot 6 \Longrightarrow \overline{HH'} = 4\]This means that $\overline{HL} = \frac12 \cdot 4 = 2$ and $\overline{AL} = 2 + 3 = 5$, where $L$ is the foot of the altitude from $A$ onto $BC$. All that remains to be found is the length of segment $\overline{BC}$.

Looking at right triangle $\triangle AHD$, we find that\[\overline{AD} = \sqrt{\overline{AH}^2 - \overline{HD}^2} = \sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{5}\]Looking at right triangle $\triangle ODY$, we get the equation\[\overline{OY}^2 - \overline{DY}^2 = \overline{OD}^2 = \left(\overline{AO} - \overline{AD}\right)^2\]Plugging in known values, and letting $R$ be the radius of the circle, we find that\[R^2 - 16 = (R - \sqrt{5})^2 = R^2 - 2\sqrt5 R + 5 \Longrightarrow R = \frac{21\sqrt5}{10}\]
Recall that $AHO'O$ is a parallelogram, so $\overline{AH} = \overline{OO'} = 3$. So, $\overline{OM} = \frac32$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. This means that\[\overline{BC} = 2\overline{BM} = 2\sqrt{R^2 - \left(\frac32\right)^2} = 2\sqrt{\frac{441}{20} - \frac{9}{4}} = \frac{6\sqrt{55}}{5}\]
Thus, the area of triangle $\triangle ABC$ is\[\frac{\overline{AL} \cdot \overline{BC}}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot \frac{6\sqrt{55}}{5}}{2} = {3\sqrt{55}}\]The answer is $3 + 55 = \boxed{058}$.","Extend $\overline{AH}$ to intersect $\omega$ again at $P$. The Power of a Point Theorem yields $HP = \tfrac{HX \cdot HY}{HA} = 4$. Because $\angle CAP=\angle CBP$, and $\angle CAP$ and $\angle CBH$ are both complements to $\angle C$, it follows that $\angle CBP = \angle CBH$, implying that $\overline{BC}$ bisects $\overline{HP}$, so the length of the altitude from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$ is $h_a = AH + \tfrac12 HP = 5$.

Let the circumcircle of $\triangle BCH$ be $\omega'$. Because $\triangle BCH \cong \triangle BCP$, the two triangles must have the same circumradius. Because the circumcircle of $\triangle BCP$ is $\omega$, the circles $\omega$ and $\omega'$ have the same radius $R$. Denote the centers of $\omega$ and $\omega'$ by $O$ and $O'$, respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{XY}$. Note that trapezoid $HMOO'$ has $\angle H = \angle M = 90^\circ$. Also $HM = XM - XH = \frac12\cdot XY - HX = 2$ and $HO' = R$. Because $\omega$ is a translation of $\omega'$ in the direction of $\overline{AH}$, it follows that $OO' = AH = 3$. Finally, the Pythagorean Theorem applied to $\triangle XMO$ yields $MO = \sqrt{R^2-16}$. Let $T$ be the projection of $O$ onto $\overline{HO'}$. Then $TO' = R-MO$, so the Pythagorean Theorem applied to $\triangle TOO'$ yields\[R - \sqrt{R^2-16} = \sqrt{3^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{5}.\]Solving for $R$ gives $R = \tfrac{21}{2\sqrt5}$. It follows from properties of the orthocenter $H$ that\[\cos\angle A = \dfrac{AH}{2R} = \dfrac{\sqrt5}{7},\]so\[\sin\angle A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\angle A} = \dfrac{2\sqrt{11}}{7}.\]Therefore by the Extended Law of Sines\[a = BC = 2R \sin\angle A = \dfrac{6\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt5},\]so\[[\triangle ABC] = \frac12 a h_a = \frac12 \cdot \frac{6\sqrt{11}}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 5 = 3\sqrt{55}.\]The requested sum is $3+55 = 58$.

We use properties of crossing chords and get\[AH \cdot HP = XH \cdot HY = 2 \cdot 6 \implies HP = 4, AP = AH + HP = 7.\]We use properties of radius perpendicular chord and get\[MH = \frac{XH + HY}{2} – HY = 2.\]We find\[\sin OAH =\frac{MH}{AH} = \frac{2}{3}  \implies  \cos OAH = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}.\]We use properties of isosceles $\triangle OAP$ and find $\hspace{5mm}R = \frac{AP}{2\cos OAP} = \frac{7}{2\frac {\sqrt{5}}{3}} = \frac{21}{2\sqrt{5}}.$
